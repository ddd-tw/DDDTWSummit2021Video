now let us take the warmness across to welcome dr stephen hover

hello taiban my name is stefan hofer and i love a good story so imagine it is 20 000 years ago it is in the middle of winter and the tribe of cave people sit around a warm fire it is quiet except for the cracking firewood then one of the elders clears their throat many summers ago a large herd of bison wandered through our hunting grounds it was the largest herd that anyone had ever seen and as the elder shares his story one of the cave people starts to use colorful rocks and coal to paint a picture and to this very day we can see this picture in the cave wall and in a sense that is what we want to do with the main storytelling we want to spark a fire tell a story and paint a picture storytelling is at the heart of human communication and it still works in the age of software the main storytelling is one of the techniques that brings domain experts product owners business analysts and software development teams together it helps them to overcome misunderstandings and to establish a common language that helps you to talk about business processes and requirements or in short to build better business software

today i'm going to introduce you to domain storytelling by showing you a short demo then i will explain the method and finally i will tell you a little bit about the influence that ddd had on domain storytelling and maybe also the influence that ddd has that domain storytelling has on ddd in its community

so i will tell you another story

this time it is about a software system that my colleagues and i built a couple of years ago it's a software system that was

supposed to help approve road work so what happened was with a group of stakeholders and they already had a set of requirements they said ah the system must support issuing permits and the sector system must support hearings and we need support on reviewing applications and many more use cases

so the problem was that we didn't really understand how all these isolated requirements make up a whole software system for for proving road work we hadn't really understood the basic business processes behind it so how does a proving roadwork typically work that was the questions that we asked our domain experts when we brought him together in a room and in front of a whiteboard and this is the story that holders

so construction company has won a tender for a road work project and before they can start they need to obtain a permit so that they can close the road to traffic so the story starts where the project supervisor awards the contract to the construction company and then they can submit the application for the permit using this new software system that we were supposed to build

now the stakeholders told us that the project supervisor should be notified whenever a new application comes in because they need to review the application and compare it with the tender documents now we didn't understand that requirement at first and they explained us well there can be for example different dates in the application than in the tender documents if for example the construction company doesn't have the necessary resources or maybe the weather has changed then they need to delay the construction work and that's why dates could differ in the application for the permit and in the tender documents

so once the application is reviewed another role comes into play a traffic authority they draft the permit

and they determine the concerned authorities for a hearing so concerned authorities those are for example police communities public transport everyone who could be affected by a construction site and they get a link to the hearing documents and can review the permit and they can submit statements where they say either it's okay or they can raise concerns like maybe they have a marathon planned or something like that that would have an influence on the construction site

so the traffic authority then considers these statements and issues the permit

and the permit is then sent to the construction company

now this whole hearing process here and drafting the permit and revising the draft considering the statements made by the concerned authorities that is something that can be repeated several times but in this story we looked at a happy path scenario so everything is fine the first draft becomes the final permit and this is often a typical way of using domain storytelling we start with a happy path and then later look into a more complicated variations of the process

so this little story and visualizing that story helped us to understand in much more detail what the system was supposed to do

and this is one of the typical cases for using domain storytelling to think about new software systems and how they should support business processes

now how does this method work

many people especially software developers tend to think about business processes and visualize business processes like this as a rather abstract but complete description of everything that could possibly happen so it's about different paths in one picture with the main storytelling we choose a different approach we think that a good example is better than a bad abstraction so we want examples first and from that knowledge from that foundation we can later build abstractions in our software

so usual usually it's sufficient to model two or three of the most important versions of the business process so the happy path maybe an important variation or common error scenario so if we look at individual paths and

therefore we don't need any any gateways or switches or ifs or case statements in our pictographic language

now domain stories can have different scopes the story that i showed you about the construction site was i would say about medium on a medium level of detail to give you some more idea how domain stories can can look i'll introduce you to another example this time it's about a movie theater so on the left side we see the process of going to the movies so this is a end-to-end business process from the customer's point of view so we have a moviegoer here they buy a ticket from a cashier and then you buy snacks and drinks from a concession stand and they showed a ticket to the usher to get access to the movie theater and so on

on the right side we see a much more detailed picture that tells you the story of buying tickets we have a moviegoer who picks seats and buys for the tickets and so on so time buying tickets was one step in the course grade story on the left and it's now a whole story on its own in the more detailed story on the right and that's just one way of

illustrating different scopes of stories now no matter the level of detail or the scope of the story you will always need a pictographic language to visualize it

so our pictographic language is comprised of a set of symbols so we have actors the person or the people or the software systems who are active in the story who do things and we have work objects those are the things that they use it can be information physical things digital objects with activities depicted as arrows and we use textual annotations

now to give those icons a concrete meaning we label them so we have a customer ticket bias and so on and if we look at the pictographic language in a little bit more detail we can have for example different actors so most commonly we use a single person a group of people a system but depending on the domain that you're in you can change and adapt the set of symbols for example i did a couple of the main stories in in the harbor domain so ships are important actors there and then have a little ship icon that represents a ship

the same is true for the work objects we also use different icons there most commonly to express the medium of a book object so for example if i call the cashier in the box office of the cinema and ask about a reservation for a movie tonight and then i would draw this with a telephone icon if they then send me a reservation as an email i will use this email icon and if i decide to print the reservation at home i will use the document icon with that pictographic language we can build sentences and the idea is that the sentence in the pictographic language reads almost like you would write a natural language sentence now to tell a story we of course need more than one sentence so what do we do we append sentences and we express the order by numbering them so that's how you find your way through the domain story

now the pictographic language is just one aspect of the main storytelling equally if not more important is that it is also a workshop format a way of bringing people together and what happens in the minds of the participants of the bookshop is very important so it's the picture is not just it's not the only result also being there being present in the workshop if you miss this campfire experience it's not the same just looking at the result showing the picture to someone who was not at a workshop that's not the same as actually being there and contributing to it

so what do we need for a workshop well we need people to tell us a story the story tells and what is a storyteller without someone who listens so we need listeners our storytellers are usually the domain experts users stakeholders and our listeners are usually members of a development team business analysts usability experts and so on and often we don't have just one storyteller but we have several storytellers so every role that is involved in a business process can contribute to the story

now storytelling is not just a one-way activity it's more of a dialogue of a discussion so storytellers or domain experts are not always born storytellers so they needs a little help that's where moderator comes comes in handy and also the listeners can ask questions to move disturbing forward so typically we would ask what's happening next or how do you know that you have to do this now or where do you get the information from to write it down somewhere and so on so we want the vivid conversation that moves forward and while the story is told it is important that it is also visualized and that's again a job that the moderator has so we visualize the story using the pictographic language while it is told so that gives everyone a chance to see if we understood the story correctly or after any mistakes in it so what will happen is that the domain experts so tell us say oh no you missed a step or no that's not what i said i used a different word or can you draw the arrow to can you turn it around this is wrong so this is very available and immediate feedback that we get for that to work everyone needs to be able to see the visualized story so we use tools for that for example we can use whiteboards and sticky notes or digital blackboards or we could use the tool that uh i used to show you the old work story it's called egon i o it's open source runs in your browser you can check it out econo is also the url now there's a lot more of course to discuss and learn about domain storytelling

i've written a book about this method together with my colleague henning schwentner so if you are curious go and check out domainstorytelling.org you will find all sorts of links there including links to the book and you can even save some money if you buy directly from edison wesley via the informant store you can use this component called domain story and get a nice discount

now how has domain storytelling influenced ddd and how is d2d influenced domain storytelling well so far i haven't really talked about ddd in fact i've barely even talked about software or developing software or modeling software and that is because domain storytelling is a modeling method that helps you to have meaningful conversations about business processes so building software for this processes is just one of many use cases for the main storytelling you could use it to analyze weaknesses and problems or you could use it to help newly hired employees to learn about your business people do that and you're happy with it

however i mostly use it in software development projects and there are some projects where i use domain storytelling like this

so i would start with analyzing the domain analyzing the problem spaced as is situation modeling it together with the domain experts so we get a couple of domain stories out from that that is something that we can learn from get feedback from we used it as a basis to design a new improved process software supported process we model that with to be domain stories that show us the future situation again we get feedback from that we use that to derive requirements on a course grade or a medium grade level for example user stories or use cases and again we get feedback on those requirements and then we build software and of course we develop it iteratively and incrementally that means we only take a couple of those requirements and refine them and when you go to the next sprint iteration we take another set of requirements and refine them so it's a constant process of refinement now this process is or this description of software development is not entirely wrong but it's certainly not completely right it's it's a bit too waterfally for me and that changed with the main driven design

in more and more of my projects i get to use ddd and eric evans provided his own metaphor for the software development cycle and that metaphor is the model exploration whirlpool and it looks like that

so the whirlpool metaphor suggests that there are interconnected cycles of storytelling modeling and coding and it is about learning and about making mistakes so we have activities that focus on housing and documenting scenarios and modeling them telling stories walking through them refocus proposing models explore the language and take those models turn them into code learn from that experiment then go back to your scenarios and

model more scenarios and other cases and so on so it's this constant whirlpool i think this model captures much better what is actually going on in a ddd style development project on the other hand this model is not as neat as the one i showed you before it looks a bit messy and maybe that is the reason why this metaphor is often neglected when people talk about ddd yet i think the more the more i think about it the more i reflect on it the more powerful this metaphor becomes for me and i mean it's easy to see that when you highlight how often the term scenario or story appears in the in the whirlpool that there's a connection to the main storytelling so for me domain storytelling fills this gap of how to actually gather my my scenarios how do i model them but how to return them how bring how do i bring them closer to developing software

so that's a way that domain storytelling can help with this model exploration whirlpool makes it more tangible but it also had an influence on domain storytelling because it helps me to better understand how to integrate the main storytelling into the domain driven design process and it helps me to choose the right scope for a story so which level of granularity am i interested in am i analyzing the current process or am i deciding a new process and so on so i think this is very helpful for that for choosing the right scope of a story

now the second aspect that has influenced the main storytelling and the development of the method is collaborative modeling

before i became a ddd practitioner and a ddd coach i was active in the academic modeling community and the software and enterprise architecture communities and in the requirements engineering community and i always felt a bit like an outsider in and one of the reasons why this is different with the ddd community is that ddd practitioners have realized the value of collaborative modeling

while i had felt that for some time it really became evident to me at explore ddd conference in the u.s where paul raynor drew this picture it shows collaborative modeling is one of the most important concepts of ddd it's one of its pillars so i felt right at home of course

while i'd felt that for some

time that collaborative modeling is an important pillar of ddd i think that many people use it synonymously with a brainstorming ever since alberto pandolini came up with it so i use events dormant too here you see my colleagues

in a big picture event storming session or some of my colleagues and i think of it as well i have a modeling toolbox and in this toolbox there are several tools like event storming and domain storytelling and um i think that in many projects you will have to use more than one modeling method and you definitely have an advantage if there are several tools in your toolbox and you know how to choose between those tools and when to choose which tool that will increase your changes your chance of success

now thinking of it as a toolbox is one way of seeing it but i think collaborative modeling could also be described as a family of methods with different relationships between them and the more i became experienced with ddd the more i looked at collaborative modeling as this family

so in my mind i would say that by now i see software development as a series of conversations that are aided by modeling with different members of this collaborative modeling family so with different tools

the community behind those methods or tools they've started to write a book called the visual collaborate collaboration tools book you can find it on leanpub and download it from there so this is a really thriving community and it's great to see um that this family is ever expanding and to see new connections made between those tools so this is definitely something that has influenced me a lot

now the final thought i want to share with you today is one of the most important concepts i think in ddd and that is that language and models are bounded by the context so this is really an eye opener

i mean words can mean different things to different people right so even if those people work in the same organization they might have different ideas for example in our movie theater what could ticket mean so for one person it could be a sellable unit that generates a profit and for the other person it could mean a piece of paper that is validated in order to grant access to a movie theater so if you look at this course-grade domain story from before again cashier might think of the ticket as something that they sell it has a price and so on and they are sure well they are not really interested in the price they are just checking if it's the right date and time right movie and then the ground access so they both say ticket but they mean different concepts when they mean ticket now this will often happen in coarse grained domain stories or also other collaborative modelling techniques that when you have different stakeholders to use the same terms without meaning exactly the same thing and this is not necessarily a problem especially on this core screen level but i'll i want to show you an example where it really was a problem for me to moderate the modeling session because there was an immediate problem that luckily i could resolve with the help of bounded contexts so this is yet another domain that tell you about this time it's a

fixtures company called awesome browser games so a company that provides a platform for playing browser games but it's based on a true story so in the workshop in a real workshop we got different people from different departments together domain expert software developers and we wanted to start with a course grain domain story that shows us an end-to-end process so a first-term user signs up plays their first game gets built for the game so someone started and say well the first step is that the user opens an account with awesome browser games and immediately someone said no they said no the account is much is created much later i know that for a fact but the first person replied no no no no you are wrong this is the first step i know it i know that for a fact this is the first thing that we do we open the account

well in the words of martin fowler single conceptual model is a tricky piece to work with and that was what we were trying to do here build a single conceptual model for terms that could not be reconciled

so bounded contexts to the rescue what did we do to resolve this situation move on forward well i said okay let's assume for a moment that the first person is right and that the account is open in the first step and then the continued modeling and eventually arrived at uh the step here the step five in the picture where the second person thinks that their account is created and we used different icons to show that we mean different things here so different kinds of accounts possibly and when we talked about it it became evident that one person thought about the account in the context of use user registration and the other person was thinking about accounts in the context of what we call the game management so there are actually two kinds of accounts here one that are per user and the other one is per user and per game so if you play different games you have different accounts one for each game so luckily we had this concept of bounded context that helped us to resolve this issue otherwise i don't think the workshop would have been a success but with this revelation and we could move on forward and had a successful workshop and actually you can use this kind of differences in languages to spot and find and identify bounded context so that's also a way how we use domain storytelling for finding bounded contexts you've you've actually seen another example already where we used bounded context and we remodeled them in a domain story and that was of course the cinema example so again on the left in the course grain story we see in the rectangles different contexts so we have ticket sales and snack sales and entrance control and in the more detailed domain story that story plays within one context within the ticket sales context and of course we want to make sure that within the ticket sales context we have the same idea of the of the terms that are used there so that we need our ubiquitous language right

so these are the three things where i think ddd has really influenced domain storytelling and influenced its development and also my personal modeling practices so we have this idea of the model exploration whirlpool a powerful metaphor a bit neglected in the ddd community sadly and we have this this big big community of collaborative modeling that is not only within ddd but also extending to other communities like behavior different development for example

and we have this game-changing concept of bounded context so the idea that language and models are bounded by the context that really changed my modeling practices

now if you want to know more about domain storytelling go check out domainstorytelling.org you will find my slides on speaker deck and now i'm looking forward for your questions thank you

okay thank you very much about dr steven overstory and right now let me see what's question that the participants asked

so there are a lot of questions on slido right yeah okay can you see my screen yes i can okay the first question is i saw there is no round trip between each component could you tell us what motivated you to create create this one-way direction to express the message flow

so i think this question refers to the roadwork construction example that i gave if i'm correct um yeah so um this is something very typical uh for software developers we often think in this kind of request response a pattern um or yeah or like you you call a method and then you get a return value or something like that i mean um you can use the main storytelling in that way but often i think it's the better idea to to use it to express an intention otherwise the the picture becomes very messy with a lot of back and forth and back and forth and back and forth without really gaining without pushing the story forward so the idea is that you express intention and not necessarily things like um you know you enter something in the system in the web page you press the button and then the web page renders a new html page and then you press the next button and then it renders a new html page this would be very boring that's not a good story there's not a lot of information in it that's that drives the conversation forward um so that's what i want to avoid and i focus more on what is the intention of this step and then it's okay to have just a one-way information flow or one way direction yeah so that's that's the idea okay thank you for your answer and the second question is have you ever

have you ever met someone asking about the compression between domestic 12 domestory telling and even swarming how do you think about it

again that is a very common question and as you saw in the in the slides uh i put one picture of our event stopping session in there that i facilitated so i use both methods plus many more i would say for the last three years or so i've used event storming and domain storytelling about uh to the same amount like 50 50 something like that

there is an overlap there are situations where you can use one or the other and will still get a good result out of it but there are also situations where i think one is better than the other and one of the indicators for me is what is this process about or what information are you looking um to to learn what what are interested in if it's about many people collaborating with each other so if you have a business process it involves many people or even many software systems and information goes from one person to the next and back and you're interested in the communication patterns and and learning how people collaborate then i think domain storytelling is the better approach because the story is centered around the the people around the actors and you can really see who is doing what with whom if on the other hand you're more interested in this time series like in in rainstorming you have this timeline from left to right and status changes and this happened better and that happened that happened that event storming is is i think the better approach but as i said um i use i use both there are situations where you can use both and you can also combine it for example in the project that i'm currently working on we started with domain storytelling to figure out the the process that this new software system should build and then the development team decided they want to implement the software using event sourcing so for big picture level we had domain stories and for design level uh for the system design we switched to event streaming because it fits much better to an event-sourced way of building systems there are more ways to combine it i have to refer you to the book for that we have a couple of examples there um yeah so okay thank you very much okay um the first question is can domestory trolling can use as a metastatology or a tool for class design in the implementation of ddd technical design

i think there was a follow-up from

kim in the in the chat so it depends on different perspective and how much focus you're looking for in time series consequences or the actors relationships yes yes i think that's right that's uh it's a good summary okay now to the next question sorry so can the mentor telling be used as a methodology or tool for class design yes it can

the funny thing about it is that domain storytelling well its predecessors are actually rather old so the first ancestor the first predecessor is from the 1990s and it was heavily influenced by object oriented modeling so you can still still see that influence and i think it is suitable as a tool for class modeling when you want an object oriented approach and it also fits nicely into the the ddd thinking because you can look at the work objects and say okay this is going to be either an entity or aggregate or maybe a value object and the arrows that depict the activities well those are the um that is the behavior of the entities and the work objects so um for example in this construction example we had permits and we had hearings and the hearing was started then statements um are considered and these are all the things that later become entities and aggregates so a hearing for example we model the hearing it's an aggregate and and stuff like that so that works um what do you need for that you need to main storytelling that you so you need the main stories that are rather fine-grained so if you're on a very overview level this wouldn't work but if if you model it rather fine-drained then you have enough language and enough expressiveness in the model that you can defer object-oriented design from that

okay thank you very much and the next question is domestic trolling as a methodology of implementing ddd what do you think is advantage and what about the disadvantage

most of the time i used to mean storytelling as a communication tool and the thing that is apart from what i just explained from that from the previous question with how you can use it to implement it but mostly um i think it's about bringing people people together having meaningful conversations about the domain and that is something that domain storytelling is uh really good at helping with this so this would be the the main advantage and um then you can drive the conversation into different directions for example you can use it to find uh bounded contexts so that would be a typical way of using it uh to implement ddd or you can use it on a lower level um to to come up with object oriented design using entities and aggregates and so on what about disadvantages well i'm a bit biased here of course i really love the main storytelling so it's it's hard to think about disadvantages but

now with the feedback okay um but um well maybe let's put it this way it's not the right tool for everything so that's why i always talk about this toolbox and um i've had situations where i thought using this this modeling method is a good idea and then we go into the workshop and it just doesn't work for some reason for for whatever reason and then it's always good if you have this toolbox of other modeling tools and say okay i'm sorry this conversation is not going forward but i have an idea uh let's use for example let's use example mapping to to to figure that out or let's use event storming and then you can switch so um i think this would be a disadvantage like um treating it as a one-size-fits-all tool for every situation that's not going to work you you will need different tools in your toolbox

okay and then the next is uh domestic trolling suitable as a ddd implementation necessary complex domain such as the banking or financial industry

yes i think so for complex domains

my colleagues and i have have used this technique and its predecessors for uh 15 years and we applied it in complex domains like healthcare banking insurance managing ports for example we had stuff like disaster management disaster disaster response teams so a whole lot of different domains logistics of course um e-commerce so it's not really bound to one domain it's really for for pretty much every domain so i have not encountered a domain yet where i say okay this doesn't fit here um yeah so i would definitely to say this is uh usable in complex domains okay thank you for your presentation um have you run into a suitable where one object can either be a working object or an actor in different sequence of one dst image how do we deal with it it's a good question it's already a bit advanced so well within the domain of course it can happen that um in in one domain story something is an actor and in one domain is something is a work object similarly to in in one valid context you can model something as an entity and in the next bounded context it's a value object because it doesn't change so that's possible but this question is about in the same picture in the same domain

again this is not a common case but it can happen for example um if we think about something like user management user registration you sign up for something you are the user you're the actor then i'm only as an actor and you open your account and then the system um creates a user as a representation of the of the human being then we have user as an actor and then we have user as a work object with the same picture but that's not a problem at all you just have to use a different icon to represent that so i would use this little stick figure for the for the actor for the person and um for example the icon set that i use that's the google material i can set they have another smaller picture of a user with a little check mark and that's the one that i typically use for stuff like um user account um so that's um that's the way um how i deal with it so use different icons to represent those different concepts and then it works

okay

as the realization of protons or service product methodology or tool does domain storytelling usually it's a great with to foreign or complete agile development process from requirements analysis to system development

uh very nice so um

one of the tools of the methods that i use um a lot in combination with domain storytelling is user story mapping why because of two reasons so

domain storytelling is always about scenarios so about typically
