dr stephen

2
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:58,990
now let us take the warmness 
across to welcome dr stephen hover

3
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,808
Hello taiban my name is Stefan Hofer and I love 
a good story. So imagine it is 20,000 years ago.

4
00:01:18,808 --> 00:01:25,200
So imagine it is 20,000 years ago.

5
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,680
It is in the middle of winter and the tribe of cave 
people sit around a warm fire.

6
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,198
It is quiet except for the cracking firewood

7
00:01:34,198 --> 00:01:37,060
then one of the elders clears their throat.

8
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,328
Many summers ago

9
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:43,460
a large herd of bison wandered through our hunting grounds

10
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,880
It was the largest herd that anyone had ever seen

11
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:56,380
and as the elder shares his story one of the cave people
starts to use colorful rocks and coal to paint a picture

12
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,014
and to this very day

13
00:01:59,014 --> 00:02:03,520
we can see this picture in the cave wall

14
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,560
and in a sense that is what we want 
to do with the main storytelling

15
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,760
we want to spark a fire tell 
a story and paint a picture

16
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,540
storytelling is at the heart of human communication
and it still works in the age of software

17
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,914
the main storytelling is one of the techniques

18
00:02:23,914 --> 00:02:30,080
that brings domain experts, product owners, business analysts 
and software development teams together

19
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,215
it helps them to overcome misunderstandings

20
00:02:33,215 --> 00:02:35,134
and to establish a common language

21
00:02:35,134 --> 00:02:38,637
that helps you to talk about business processes and requirements

22
00:02:38,637 --> 00:02:41,600
or in short to build better business software

23
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,080
today i'm going to introduce you to domain 
storytelling by showing you a short demo

24
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,903
then i will explain the method and finally i will

25
00:02:53,903 --> 00:02:58,073
tell you a little bit about the influence that ddd had on

26
00:02:58,073 --> 00:03:03,579
the domain storytelling and maybe also the influence that ddd has

27
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:06,800
that domain storytelling 
has on ddd in its community

28
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,880
so i will tell you another story

29
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,480
this time it is about a software system that 
my colleagues and i built a couple of years ago

30
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,900
it's a software system that was

31
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,561
supposed to help approve road work

32
00:03:27,561 --> 00:03:31,899
so what happened was with a group of stakeholders

33
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:34,652
and they already had a set of requirements

34
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,600
they said ah the system must support issuing permits

35
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:45,840
and the sector system must support hearings and we need support 
on reviewing applications and many more use cases

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,836
so the problem was that we didn't really 
understand how all these

37
00:03:52,836 --> 00:03:57,132
isolated requirements make up a whole software system

38
00:03:57,132 --> 00:04:02,388
for for proving road work we hadn't really 
understood the basic business processes behind it

39
00:04:02,388 --> 00:04:06,560
so how does a proving roadwork typically work

40
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,320
that was the questions that we asked our domain 
experts when we brought him together in a room

41
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,440
and in front of a whiteboard and 
this is the story that holders

42
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,457
so construction company has won a tender for a road work project

43
00:04:30,457 --> 00:04:36,046
before they can start they need to obtain a permit 
so that they can close the road to traffic

44
00:04:36,046 --> 00:04:43,520
so the story starts where the project supervisor awards 
the contract to the construction company

45
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,800
and then they can submit the application for the permit

46
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,680
using this new software system that we were supposed to build

47
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,200
now the stakeholders told us that the project supervisor should be notified

48
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,325
whenever a new application comes in

49
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,260
because they need to review the application 
and compare it with the tender documents

50
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,792
now we didn't understand that requirement at first and

51
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:17,046
and they explained us well there can be

52
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,700
for example different dates in the application

53
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,468
than in the tender documents

54
00:05:22,468 --> 00:05:26,138
if for example the construction company

55
00:05:26,138 --> 00:05:28,880
doesn't have the necessary resources

56
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,393
or maybe the weather has changed

57
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,120
then they need to delay the construction work

58
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,441
that's why dates could differ

59
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:41,120
in the application for the permit 
and in the tender documents

60
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,617
so once the application is reviewed

61
00:05:46,617 --> 00:05:49,440
another role comes into play a traffic authority

62
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,800
they draft the permit

63
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,462
and they determine the concerned authorities

64
00:05:58,462 --> 00:06:02,480
for a hearing so concerned authorities

65
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,320
those are for example police communities 
public transport everyone who could

66
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,120
be affected by a construction site and 
they get a link to the hearing documents

67
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:21,280
and can review the permit and they can submit 
statements where they say either it's okay or

68
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,320
they can raise concerns like maybe they have 
a marathon planned or something like that

69
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,840
that would have an influence 
on the construction site

70
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:40,000
so the traffic authority then considers 
these statements and issues the permit

71
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,840
and the permit is then sent 
to the construction company

72
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:58,000
now this whole hearing process here and drafting 
the permit and revising the draft considering the

73
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,600
statements made by the concerned authorities that 
is something that can be repeated several times

74
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:12,000
but in this story we looked at a happy path 
scenario so everything is fine the first draft

75
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:20,320
becomes the final permit and this is often 
a typical way of using domain storytelling

76
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:29,840
we start with a happy path and then later look 
into a more complicated variations of the process

77
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,080
so this little story and visualizing 
that story helped us to understand in

78
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,320
much more detail what the 
system was supposed to do

79
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,120
and this is one of the typical 
cases for using domain storytelling

80
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,200
to think about new software systems and 
how they should support business processes

81
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,280
now how does this method work

82
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,400
many people especially software developers tend 
to think about business processes and visualize

83
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:22,400
business processes like this as a rather abstract 
but complete description of everything that could

84
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:30,160
possibly happen so it's about different paths in 
one picture with the main storytelling we choose a

85
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:37,120
different approach we think that a good example is 
better than a bad abstraction so we want examples

86
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,040
first and from that knowledge from that foundation 
we can later build abstractions in our software

87
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,240
so usual usually it's sufficient to model two 
or three of the most important versions of the

88
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,760
business process so the happy path maybe an 
important variation or common error scenario

89
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,680
so if we look at individual paths and

90
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,840
therefore we don't need any any 
gateways or switches or ifs or

91
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,920
case statements in our pictographic language

92
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,960
now domain stories can have different 
scopes the story that i showed you about

93
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:26,880
the construction site was i would say 
about medium on a medium level of detail

94
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:33,920
to give you some more idea how domain stories can 
can look i'll introduce you to another example

95
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:42,560
this time it's about a movie theater so on 
the left side we see the process of going

96
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:50,080
to the movies so this is a end-to-end business 
process from the customer's point of view so we

97
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,720
have a moviegoer here they buy a ticket from a 
cashier and then you buy snacks and drinks from

98
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:03,840
a concession stand and they showed a ticket to the 
usher to get access to the movie theater and so on

99
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:13,120
on the right side we see a much more 
detailed picture that tells you the story

100
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:20,320
of buying tickets we have a moviegoer who 
picks seats and buys for the tickets and so on

101
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:28,400
so time buying tickets was one step in the 
course grade story on the left and it's now

102
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:35,680
a whole story on its own in the more detailed 
story on the right and that's just one way of

103
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,920
illustrating different scopes of stories 
now no matter the level of detail or the

104
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,560
scope of the story you will always need 
a pictographic language to visualize it

105
00:10:51,040 --> 00:11:01,520
so our pictographic language is comprised of a 
set of symbols so we have actors the person or the

106
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,960
people or the software systems who 
are active in the story who do things

107
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,840
and we have work objects those are the things that 
they use it can be information physical things

108
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,960
digital objects with activities depicted 
as arrows and we use textual annotations

109
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:29,520
now to give those icons a concrete meaning we 
label them so we have a customer ticket bias and

110
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,920
so on and if we look at the pictographic 
language in a little bit more detail

111
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,960
we can have for example different actors so most 
commonly we use a single person a group of people

112
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:47,040
a system but depending on the domain that you're 
in you can change and adapt the set of symbols

113
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:56,000
for example i did a couple of the main stories 
in in the harbor domain so ships are important

114
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,280
actors there and then have a little 
ship icon that represents a ship

115
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:09,200
the same is true for the work objects we also use 
different icons there most commonly to express

116
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:17,120
the medium of a book object so for example if i 
call the cashier in the box office of the cinema

117
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:24,800
and ask about a reservation for a movie tonight 
and then i would draw this with a telephone icon

118
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:33,280
if they then send me a reservation as an email i 
will use this email icon and if i decide to print

119
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:41,200
the reservation at home i will use the document 
icon with that pictographic language we can build

120
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:49,280
sentences and the idea is that the sentence in the 
pictographic language reads almost like you would

121
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:57,520
write a natural language sentence now to tell a 
story we of course need more than one sentence

122
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:04,480
so what do we do we append sentences and 
we express the order by numbering them

123
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,720
so that's how you find your 
way through the domain story

124
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,200
now the pictographic language is just 
one aspect of the main storytelling

125
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:25,520
equally if not more important is that it is also a 
workshop format a way of bringing people together

126
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:31,120
and what happens in the minds of the participants 
of the bookshop is very important so it's the

127
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,240
picture is not just it's not the only result 
also being there being present in the workshop

128
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,160
if you miss this campfire experience 
it's not the same just looking at

129
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,520
the result showing the picture to 
someone who was not at a workshop

130
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,400
that's not the same as actually 
being there and contributing to it

131
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,000
so what do we need for a workshop well we 
need people to tell us a story the story tells

132
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,520
and what is a storyteller 
without someone who listens so

133
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:07,920
we need listeners our storytellers are usually 
the domain experts users stakeholders and

134
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:15,840
our listeners are usually members of a development 
team business analysts usability experts and so on

135
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,040
and often we don't have just one storyteller 
but we have several storytellers so every

136
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,640
role that is involved in a business 
process can contribute to the story

137
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:35,680
now storytelling is not just a one-way activity 
it's more of a dialogue of a discussion

138
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:44,080
so storytellers or domain experts are not always 
born storytellers so they needs a little help

139
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:51,280
that's where moderator comes comes in handy 
and also the listeners can ask questions to

140
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:57,120
move disturbing forward so typically we would 
ask what's happening next or how do you know

141
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,240
that you have to do this now or where do you get 
the information from to write it down somewhere

142
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:09,920
and so on so we want the vivid conversation 
that moves forward and while the story is

143
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:20,160
told it is important that it is also visualized 
and that's again a job that the moderator has

144
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:28,000
so we visualize the story using the pictographic 
language while it is told so that gives everyone a

145
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,720
chance to see if we understood the story correctly 
or after any mistakes in it so what will happen is

146
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:41,040
that the domain experts so tell us say oh no you 
missed a step or no that's not what i said i used

147
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:49,200
a different word or can you draw the arrow to can 
you turn it around this is wrong so this is very

148
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:55,920
available and immediate feedback that we get for 
that to work everyone needs to be able to see the

149
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:04,320
visualized story so we use tools for that for 
example we can use whiteboards and sticky notes

150
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:13,360
or digital blackboards or we could use the tool 
that uh i used to show you the old work story

151
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,920
it's called egon i o it's open source runs in your 
browser you can check it out econo is also the url

152
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:27,360
now there's a lot more of course to 
discuss and learn about domain storytelling

153
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,200
i've written a book about this method together 
with my colleague henning schwentner so if you are

154
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,800
curious go and check out domainstorytelling.org 
you will find all sorts of links there including

155
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:47,040
links to the book and you can even save some 
money if you buy directly from edison wesley via

156
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,160
the informant store you can use this component 
called domain story and get a nice discount

157
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:04,240
now how has domain storytelling influenced ddd 
and how is d2d influenced domain storytelling

158
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:12,960
well so far i haven't really talked about ddd 
in fact i've barely even talked about software

159
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,840
or developing software or modeling software 
and that is because domain storytelling

160
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:24,080
is a modeling method that helps you to have 
meaningful conversations about business processes

161
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,080
so building software for this processes is just 
one of many use cases for the main storytelling

162
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,680
you could use it to analyze weaknesses and 
problems or you could use it to help newly

163
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,160
hired employees to learn about your business 
people do that and you're happy with it

164
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,080
however i mostly use it in 
software development projects

165
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,640
and there are some projects where 
i use domain storytelling like this

166
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,840
so i would start with analyzing the domain 
analyzing the problem spaced as is situation

167
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,120
modeling it together with the domain experts so 
we get a couple of domain stories out from that

168
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,160
that is something that we can learn from get 
feedback from we used it as a basis to design

169
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:16,480
a new improved process software supported process 
we model that with to be domain stories that show

170
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:23,120
us the future situation again we get feedback 
from that we use that to derive requirements

171
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:30,240
on a course grade or a medium grade level for 
example user stories or use cases and again we get

172
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,560
feedback on those requirements and then we build 
software and of course we develop it iteratively

173
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,680
and incrementally that means we only take a 
couple of those requirements and refine them

174
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:47,680
and when you go to the next sprint iteration we 
take another set of requirements and refine them

175
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:54,560
so it's a constant process of refinement 
now this process is or this description

176
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:00,400
of software development is not entirely 
wrong but it's certainly not completely

177
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:09,840
right it's it's a bit too waterfally for me 
and that changed with the main driven design

178
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,440
in more and more of my projects i get to use ddd

179
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,920
and eric evans provided his own metaphor 
for the software development cycle

180
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,840
and that metaphor is the model exploration 
whirlpool and it looks like that

181
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,480
so the whirlpool metaphor suggests 
that there are interconnected cycles

182
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,480
of storytelling modeling and coding and it 
is about learning and about making mistakes

183
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:46,800
so we have activities that focus on housing 
and documenting scenarios and modeling them

184
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:55,360
telling stories walking through them refocus 
proposing models explore the language and take

185
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:01,280
those models turn them into code learn from that 
experiment then go back to your scenarios and

186
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:10,800
model more scenarios and other cases and so on so 
it's this constant whirlpool i think this model

187
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:18,320
captures much better what is actually going on 
in a ddd style development project on the other

188
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:24,640
hand this model is not as neat as the one i showed 
you before it looks a bit messy and maybe that is

189
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:33,840
the reason why this metaphor is often neglected 
when people talk about ddd yet i think the more

190
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:42,160
the more i think about it the more i reflect on it 
the more powerful this metaphor becomes for me and

191
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:50,000
i mean it's easy to see that when you highlight 
how often the term scenario or story appears

192
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:59,440
in the in the whirlpool that there's a connection 
to the main storytelling so for me domain

193
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:07,360
storytelling fills this gap of how to actually 
gather my my scenarios how do i model them

194
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:15,840
but how to return them how bring how do i 
bring them closer to developing software

195
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,840
so that's a way that domain storytelling can help 
with this model exploration whirlpool makes it

196
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:30,800
more tangible but it also had an influence 
on domain storytelling because it helps me

197
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:36,960
to better understand how to integrate the main 
storytelling into the domain driven design process

198
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,160
and it helps me to choose the right scope 
for a story so which level of granularity

199
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:48,640
am i interested in am i analyzing the current 
process or am i deciding a new process and so

200
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,680
on so i think this is very helpful for that 
for choosing the right scope of a story

201
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,040
now the second aspect that has influenced the main

202
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,960
storytelling and the development of 
the method is collaborative modeling

203
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:15,600
before i became a ddd practitioner and a ddd coach 
i was active in the academic modeling community

204
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,400
and the software and enterprise architecture 
communities and in the requirements engineering

205
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:28,880
community and i always felt a bit like an outsider 
in and one of the reasons why this is different

206
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:40,000
with the ddd community is that ddd practitioners 
have realized the value of collaborative modeling

207
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,680
while i had felt that for some time it really 
became evident to me at explore ddd conference

208
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:52,960
in the u.s where paul raynor drew this picture 
it shows collaborative modeling is one of the

209
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,320
most important concepts of ddd it's one of 
its pillars so i felt right at home of course

210
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,040
while i'd felt that for some

211
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:19,440
time that collaborative modeling is an 
important pillar of ddd i think that many people

212
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,560
use it synonymously with a brainstorming 
ever since alberto pandolini came up with it

213
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,280
so i use events dormant too 
here you see my colleagues

214
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,160
in a big picture event storming 
session or some of my colleagues

215
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,640
and i think of it as well 
i have a modeling toolbox

216
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:47,600
and in this toolbox there are several tools like 
event storming and domain storytelling and um

217
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:56,240
i think that in many projects you will have to use 
more than one modeling method and you definitely

218
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,520
have an advantage if there are several tools in 
your toolbox and you know how to choose between

219
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,400
those tools and when to choose which tool that 
will increase your changes your chance of success

220
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:17,440
now thinking of it as a toolbox is one way of 
seeing it but i think collaborative modeling

221
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:25,760
could also be described as a family of methods 
with different relationships between them and

222
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:36,560
the more i became experienced with ddd the more 
i looked at collaborative modeling as this family

223
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:47,200
so in my mind i would say that by now i see 
software development as a series of conversations

224
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,800
that are aided by modeling with different

225
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,520
members of this collaborative modeling 
family so with different tools

226
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:05,440
the community behind those methods or tools 
they've started to write a book called

227
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,280
the visual collaborate collaboration 
tools book you can find it on leanpub

228
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:16,400
and download it from there so this is a really 
thriving community and it's great to see

229
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:23,040
um that this family is ever expanding and to 
see new connections made between those tools

230
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,840
so this is definitely something 
that has influenced me a lot

231
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,040
now the final thought i want 
to share with you today is

232
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,320
one of the most important concepts i think in ddd

233
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:45,760
and that is that language and models are bounded 
by the context so this is really an eye opener

234
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,480
i mean words can mean different 
things to different people

235
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,640
right so even if those people work in the same 
organization they might have different ideas

236
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:06,400
for example in our movie theater what could ticket 
mean so for one person it could be a sellable unit

237
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,440
that generates a profit and for the other person 
it could mean a piece of paper that is validated

238
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:17,680
in order to grant access to a movie theater so if 
you look at this course-grade domain story from

239
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:24,240
before again cashier might think of the ticket as 
something that they sell it has a price and so on

240
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,280
and they are sure well they are not really 
interested in the price they are just

241
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:33,120
checking if it's the right date and time right 
movie and then the ground access so they both

242
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:41,840
say ticket but they mean different concepts when 
they mean ticket now this will often happen in

243
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,920
coarse grained domain stories or also other 
collaborative modelling techniques that when

244
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:52,080
you have different stakeholders to use the same 
terms without meaning exactly the same thing

245
00:26:53,600 --> 00:27:00,160
and this is not necessarily a problem especially 
on this core screen level but i'll i want to show

246
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:08,560
you an example where it really was a problem 
for me to moderate the modeling session because

247
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:15,440
there was an immediate problem that luckily i 
could resolve with the help of bounded contexts

248
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,400
so this is yet another domain that 
tell you about this time it's a

249
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:31,520
fixtures company called awesome browser games 
so a company that provides a platform for

250
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:38,400
playing browser games but it's based on a true 
story so in the workshop in a real workshop we

251
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,520
got different people from different departments 
together domain expert software developers

252
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,880
and we wanted to start with a course grain 
domain story that shows us an end-to-end

253
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,560
process so a first-term user signs up plays 
their first game gets built for the game

254
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,440
so someone started and say well the first step 
is that the user opens an account with awesome

255
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:08,800
browser games and immediately someone said no they 
said no the account is much is created much later

256
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:15,280
i know that for a fact but the first person 
replied no no no no you are wrong this is the

257
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:20,320
first step i know it i know that for a fact this 
is the first thing that we do we open the account

258
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,160
well in the words of martin fowler

259
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,120
single conceptual model is a tricky piece to 
work with and that was what we were trying to

260
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:41,520
do here build a single conceptual model 
for terms that could not be reconciled

261
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,320
so bounded contexts to the rescue what 
did we do to resolve this situation

262
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:56,320
move on forward well i said okay let's assume 
for a moment that the first person is right

263
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,120
and that the account is open in the first step 
and then the continued modeling and eventually

264
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,800
arrived at uh the step here the step five in the 
picture where the second person thinks that their

265
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:13,120
account is created and we used different icons 
to show that we mean different things here so

266
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,720
different kinds of accounts possibly and 
when we talked about it it became evident

267
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:29,360
that one person thought about the account in 
the context of use user registration and the

268
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:36,800
other person was thinking about accounts in 
the context of what we call the game management

269
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:44,320
so there are actually two kinds of accounts here 
one that are per user and the other one is per

270
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,280
user and per game so if you play different games 
you have different accounts one for each game

271
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:57,520
so luckily we had this concept of bounded 
context that helped us to resolve this issue

272
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:04,080
otherwise i don't think the workshop would 
have been a success but with this revelation

273
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,560
and we could move on forward 
and had a successful workshop

274
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:17,520
and actually you can use this kind of differences 
in languages to spot and find and identify

275
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,280
bounded context so that's also a way how we use 
domain storytelling for finding bounded contexts

276
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,480
you've you've actually seen 
another example already

277
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,680
where we used bounded context and we remodeled 
them in a domain story and that was of course the

278
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:40,400
cinema example so again on the left in the 
course grain story we see in the rectangles

279
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,520
different contexts so we have ticket 
sales and snack sales and entrance control

280
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:53,120
and in the more detailed domain story that story 
plays within one context within the ticket sales

281
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,000
context and of course we want to make sure that 
within the ticket sales context we have the same

282
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,400
idea of the of the terms that are used there 
so that we need our ubiquitous language right

283
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:14,000
so these are the three things where i think 
ddd has really influenced domain storytelling

284
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,840
and influenced its development and also my 
personal modeling practices so we have this idea

285
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:26,160
of the model exploration whirlpool a powerful 
metaphor a bit neglected in the ddd community

286
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:34,560
sadly and we have this this big big community of 
collaborative modeling that is not only within ddd

287
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:38,400
but also extending to other communities like 
behavior different development for example

288
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:46,160
and we have this game-changing concept of 
bounded context so the idea that language

289
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:50,960
and models are bounded by the context 
that really changed my modeling practices

290
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:59,120
now if you want to know more about domain 
storytelling go check out domainstorytelling.org

291
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:05,200
you will find my slides on speaker deck and now 
i'm looking forward for your questions thank you

292
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,160
okay thank you very much about dr steven overstory

293
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:27,840
and right now let me see what's 
question that the participants asked

294
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:38,080
so there are a lot of questions on slido 
right yeah okay can you see my screen

295
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:49,280
yes i can okay the first question is i saw there 
is no round trip between each component could you

296
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:58,080
tell us what motivated you to create create this 
one-way direction to express the message flow

297
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:09,840
so i think this question refers to the roadwork 
construction example that i gave if i'm correct

298
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:18,160
um yeah so um this is something very 
typical uh for software developers

299
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:29,680
we often think in this kind of request response a 
pattern um or yeah or like you you call a method

300
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:37,360
and then you get a return value or something like 
that i mean um you can use the main storytelling

301
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:44,240
in that way but often i think it's the better 
idea to to use it to express an intention

302
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:50,960
otherwise the the picture becomes very messy 
with a lot of back and forth and back and forth

303
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:57,520
and back and forth without really gaining without 
pushing the story forward so the idea is that you

304
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:05,120
express intention and not necessarily things like 
um you know you enter something in the system in

305
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,320
the web page you press the button and then the 
web page renders a new html page and then you

306
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,840
press the next button and then it renders a new 
html page this would be very boring that's not a

307
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:23,280
good story there's not a lot of information in it 
that's that drives the conversation forward um so

308
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,840
that's what i want to avoid and i focus more on 
what is the intention of this step and then it's

309
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:38,320
okay to have just a one-way information flow or 
one way direction yeah so that's that's the idea

310
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:45,040
okay thank you for your answer and 
the second question is have you ever

311
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:52,560
have you ever met someone asking about 
the compression between domestic 12

312
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,160
domestory telling and even 
swarming how do you think about it

313
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,680
again that is a very common question and 
as you saw in the in the slides uh i put

314
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:09,120
one picture of our event stopping session 
in there that i facilitated so i use both

315
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:18,880
methods plus many more i would say for the last 
three years or so i've used event storming and

316
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,800
domain storytelling about uh to the same 
amount like 50 50 something like that

317
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:34,880
there is an overlap there are situations where you 
can use one or the other and will still get a good

318
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,400
result out of it but there are also situations 
where i think one is better than the other and one

319
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:50,080
of the indicators for me is what is this process 
about or what information are you looking um

320
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:57,360
to to learn what what are interested in if it's 
about many people collaborating with each other

321
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:02,800
so if you have a business process it involves 
many people or even many software systems and

322
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,920
information goes from one person to the next and 
back and you're interested in the communication

323
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:15,520
patterns and and learning how people collaborate 
then i think domain storytelling is the better

324
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,080
approach because the story is centered 
around the the people around the actors

325
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:26,560
and you can really see who is doing what with 
whom if on the other hand you're more interested

326
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:33,360
in this time series like in in rainstorming you 
have this timeline from left to right and status

327
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:39,520
changes and this happened better and that happened 
that happened that event storming is is i think

328
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:48,240
the better approach but as i said um i use i use 
both there are situations where you can use both

329
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:56,720
and you can also combine it for example in the 
project that i'm currently working on we started

330
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:02,240
with domain storytelling to figure out the the 
process that this new software system should build

331
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:09,840
and then the development team decided they want to 
implement the software using event sourcing so for

332
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:17,280
big picture level we had domain stories and for 
design level uh for the system design we switched

333
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:24,800
to event streaming because it fits much better to 
an event-sourced way of building systems there are

334
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:31,360
more ways to combine it i have to refer you to the 
book for that we have a couple of examples there

335
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:42,400
um yeah so okay thank you very much okay um the 
first question is can domestory trolling can use

336
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:49,840
as a metastatology or a tool for class design 
in the implementation of ddd technical design

337
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,720
i think there was a follow-up from

338
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,840
kim in the in the chat so it depends on different 
perspective and how much focus you're looking

339
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,320
for in time series consequences or 
the actors relationships yes yes

340
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:13,920
i think that's right that's uh it's a 
good summary okay now to the next question

341
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:20,320
sorry so can the mentor telling be used as a 
methodology or tool for class design yes it can

342
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:28,160
the funny thing about it is that domain 
storytelling well its predecessors are

343
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:36,800
actually rather old so the first ancestor the 
first predecessor is from the 1990s and it was

344
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:45,200
heavily influenced by object oriented modeling so 
you can still still see that influence and i think

345
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:55,120
it is suitable as a tool for class modeling when 
you want an object oriented approach and it also

346
00:38:55,120 --> 00:39:01,680
fits nicely into the the ddd thinking because 
you can look at the work objects and say okay

347
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:10,000
this is going to be either an entity or aggregate 
or maybe a value object and the arrows that depict

348
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:18,080
the activities well those are the um that is the 
behavior of the entities and the work objects

349
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:28,320
so um for example in this construction example we 
had permits and we had hearings and the hearing

350
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:35,520
was started then statements um are considered 
and these are all the things that later become

351
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:42,560
entities and aggregates so a hearing for example 
we model the hearing it's an aggregate and and

352
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:48,880
stuff like that so that works um what do you need 
for that you need to main storytelling that you

353
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,680
so you need the main stories that are rather 
fine-grained so if you're on a very overview

354
00:39:53,680 --> 00:40:02,400
level this wouldn't work but if if you model it 
rather fine-drained then you have enough language

355
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,280
and enough expressiveness in the model that 
you can defer object-oriented design from that

356
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:17,520
okay thank you very much and the next question 
is domestic trolling as a methodology of

357
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:24,320
implementing ddd what do you think is 
advantage and what about the disadvantage

358
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:38,480
most of the time i used to mean storytelling 
as a communication tool and the thing that

359
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,680
is apart from what i just explained from that 
from the previous question with how you can use

360
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:51,840
it to implement it but mostly um i think it's 
about bringing people people together having

361
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:58,720
meaningful conversations about the domain and 
that is something that domain storytelling is uh

362
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:07,600
really good at helping with this so this would be 
the the main advantage and um then you can drive

363
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:13,680
the conversation into different directions for 
example you can use it to find uh bounded contexts

364
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:21,040
so that would be a typical way of using it uh to 
implement ddd or you can use it on a lower level

365
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:27,440
um to to come up with object oriented design 
using entities and aggregates and so on

366
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,120
what about disadvantages well i'm a 
bit biased here of course i really

367
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:41,840
love the main storytelling so it's it's 
hard to think about disadvantages but

368
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:52,560
now with the feedback okay um but 
um well maybe let's put it this way

369
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:58,800
it's not the right tool for everything so 
that's why i always talk about this toolbox

370
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:08,720
and um i've had situations where i thought using 
this this modeling method is a good idea and

371
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:14,720
then we go into the workshop and it just doesn't 
work for some reason for for whatever reason and

372
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,840
then it's always good if you have this toolbox 
of other modeling tools and say okay i'm sorry

373
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:26,000
this conversation is not going forward but i 
have an idea uh let's use for example let's

374
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,880
use example mapping to to to figure that out or 
let's use event storming and then you can switch

375
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,920
so um i think this would be a disadvantage like 
um treating it as a one-size-fits-all tool for

376
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:44,800
every situation that's not going to work you 
you will need different tools in your toolbox

377
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:55,120
okay and then the next is uh 
domestic trolling suitable as a ddd

378
00:42:55,120 --> 00:43:02,080
implementation necessary complex domain 
such as the banking or financial industry

379
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,600
yes i think so for complex domains

380
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,400
my colleagues and i have have used 
this technique and its predecessors

381
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:24,400
for uh 15 years and we applied it in complex 
domains like healthcare banking insurance

382
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,680
managing ports for example we had stuff like

383
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:42,720
disaster management disaster disaster response 
teams so a whole lot of different domains

384
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:52,160
logistics of course um e-commerce so it's not 
really bound to one domain it's really for for

385
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:57,440
pretty much every domain so i have not encountered 
a domain yet where i say okay this doesn't

386
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:04,080
fit here um yeah so i would definitely to 
say this is uh usable in complex domains

387
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:16,000
okay thank you for your presentation um have you 
run into a suitable where one object can either be

388
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:26,320
a working object or an actor in different sequence 
of one dst image how do we deal with it it's a

389
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:37,520
good question it's already a bit advanced so well 
within the domain of course it can happen that um

390
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:42,560
in in one domain story something is an 
actor and in one domain is something is

391
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:48,960
a work object similarly to in in one valid 
context you can model something as an entity

392
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,720
and in the next bounded context it's a 
value object because it doesn't change

393
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,320
so that's possible but this question is 
about in the same picture in the same domain

394
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:09,760
again this is not a common case but it can 
happen for example um if we think about

395
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:16,160
something like user management user registration 
you sign up for something you are the user you're

396
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:23,280
the actor then i'm only as an actor and you open 
your account and then the system um creates a user

397
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:31,200
as a representation of the of the human being 
then we have user as an actor and then we have

398
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:38,240
user as a work object with the same picture but 
that's not a problem at all you just have to use

399
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:44,960
a different icon to represent that so i would use 
this little stick figure for the for the actor

400
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:52,080
for the person and um for example the icon set 
that i use that's the google material i can set

401
00:45:53,200 --> 00:46:00,000
they have another smaller picture of a user with 
a little check mark and that's the one that i

402
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:09,120
typically use for stuff like um user account um so 
that's um that's the way um how i deal with it so

403
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:13,840
use different icons to represent those 
different concepts and then it works

404
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,260
okay

405
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:28,880
as the realization of protons or service 
product methodology or tool does domain

406
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:35,840
storytelling usually it's a great with to 
foreign or complete agile development process

407
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:42,080
from requirements analysis to system development

408
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,840
uh very nice so um

409
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:57,760
one of the tools of the methods that i use um 
a lot in combination with domain storytelling

410
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:04,560
is user story mapping. Why? 
Because of two reasons so

411
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:14,640
domain storytelling is always 
about scenarios so about typically
