00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:18,764
Hello Taiwan, my name is Stefan Hofer, and I love a good story.

2
00:01:19,436 --> 00:01:24,668
 So imagine it was 20,000 years ago.

3
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:30,572
It is in the middle of winter and the tribe of cave people sit around a warm fire.

4
00:01:30,764 --> 00:01:34,172
It is quiet except for the cracking firewood, 

5
00:01:34,412 --> 00:01:37,340
then one of the elders clears their throat.

6
00:01:37,724 --> 00:01:39,596
Many summers ago, 

7
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,580
a large herd of bison wandered through our hunting grounds 

8
00:01:43,676 --> 00:01:47,276
It was the largest herd that anyone had ever seen.

9
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:56,396
And as the elder shares his story one of the cave people starts to use colorful rocks and coal to paint a picture.

10
00:01:56,828 --> 00:02:04,028
And to this very day, we can see this picture in the cave wall.

11
00:02:04,508 --> 00:02:08,972
In the sense that is what we want to do with the Domain Storytelling.

12
00:02:09,548 --> 00:02:14,300
We want to spark a fire, tell a story and paint a picture.

13
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:21,500
Storytelling is at the heart of human communication and it still works in the age of software.

14
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,628
Domain storytelling is one of the techniques that brings domain experts,  

15
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:29,900
product owners, business analysts, and software development teams together.

16
00:02:29,996 --> 00:02:32,780
It helps them to overcome misunderstandings

17
00:02:33,163 --> 00:02:35,119
and to establish a common language 

18
00:02:35,263 --> 00:02:38,623
that helps you to talk about business processes and requirements

19
00:02:38,815 --> 00:02:41,791
or in short to build better business software.

20
00:02:44,863 --> 00:02:49,903
Today, I'm going to introduce you to Domain Storytelling by showing you a short demo.

21
00:02:50,096 --> 00:02:51,673
then I will explain the method 

22
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:55,993
and finally, I will tell you a little bit about the influence that 

23
00:02:56,089 --> 00:03:01,129
DDD had on Domain Storytelling and maybe also the influence that 

24
00:03:01,177 --> 00:03:06,889
DDD has that Domain Storytelling has on DDD in its community.

25
00:03:08,905 --> 00:03:11,161
So I will tell you another story.

26
00:03:12,697 --> 00:03:15,577
This time it is about a software system 

27
00:03:15,994 --> 00:03:19,643
that my colleagues and I built a couple of years ago.

28
00:03:20,603 --> 00:03:27,179
It's a software system that was supposed to help approve roadwork. 

29
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:31,643
So what happened was with a group of stakeholders 

30
00:03:31,883 --> 00:03:34,523
and they already had a set of requirements.

31
00:03:34,763 --> 00:03:37,451
They said the system must support issuing permits 

32
00:03:37,595 --> 00:03:40,043
and the sector system must support hearings, 

33
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:43,115
and we need support on reviewing applications and 

34
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:45,323
many more use cases.

35
00:03:47,723 --> 00:03:52,571
so the problem was that we didn't really understand how all these 

36
00:03:53,003 --> 00:03:57,179
isolated requirements make up a whole software system 

37
00:03:57,275 --> 00:04:02,075
for for proving roadwork we hadn't really understood the basic business processes behind it 

38
00:04:02,795 --> 00:04:06,395
so how does a proving roadwork typically work 

39
00:04:06,587 --> 00:04:09,947
that was the questions that we asked our domain experts 

40
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:12,059
when we brought him together in a room 

41
00:04:12,395 --> 00:04:13,931
and in front of a whiteboard 

42
00:04:14,747 --> 00:04:17,819
and this is the story that holders.

43
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:30,011
So construction company has won a tender for a roadwork project 

44
00:04:30,299 --> 00:04:35,675
and before they can start they need to obtain a permit so that they can close the road to traffic 

45
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:43,691
so the story starts where the project supervisor awards the contract to the construction company 

46
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:51,995
and then they can submit the application for the permit using this new software system that we were supposed to build

47
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:00,875
now the stakeholders told us that the project supervisor should be notified 

48
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:06,299
whenever a new application comes in because they need to review the application 

49
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:09,995
and compare it with the tender documents 

50
00:05:10,475 --> 00:05:13,451
We didn't understand that requirement at first 

51
00:05:13,787 --> 00:05:16,859
and they explained us well there can be 

52
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:22,331
for example different dates in the application than in the tender documents 

53
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:28,571
if for example the construction company doesn't have the necessary resources

54
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:31,115
or maybe the weather has changed 

55
00:05:31,403 --> 00:05:34,235
then they need to delay the construction work 

56
00:05:34,619 --> 00:05:41,147
and that's why dates could differ in the application for the permit and in the tender documents

57
00:05:42,923 --> 00:05:46,523
so once the application is reviewed 

58
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:49,499
another role comes into play a traffic authority 

59
00:05:50,843 --> 00:05:52,763
they draft the permit

60
00:05:54,731 --> 00:06:00,059
and they determine the concerned authorities for a hearing 

61
00:06:00,635 --> 00:06:02,795
so concerned authorities 

62
00:06:03,131 --> 00:06:07,451
those are for example: police, communities, public transport, 

63
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:10,283
everyone who could be affected by a construction site 

64
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:13,451
and they get a link to the hearing documents 

65
00:06:14,171 --> 00:06:16,619
and can review the permit 

66
00:06:17,051 --> 00:06:19,355
and they can submit statements 

67
00:06:19,665 --> 00:06:22,833
where they say either it's okay or they can raise concerns 

68
00:06:23,025 --> 00:06:26,865
like maybe they have a marathon planned or something like that 

69
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:30,945
that would have an influence on the construction site

70
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:40,689
So the traffic authority then considers these statements and issues the permit

71
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:46,785
and the permit is then sent to the construction company

72
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:55,281
Now this whole hearing process here and drafting the permit 

73
00:06:55,377 --> 00:07:00,705
and revising the draft considering the statements made by the concerned authorities 

74
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:04,209
that is something that can be repeated several times 

75
00:07:04,353 --> 00:07:08,481
but in this story we looked at a happy path scenario 

76
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,073
so everything is fine 

77
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:14,337
the first draft becomes the final permit 

78
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:19,329
and this is often a typical way 

79
00:07:19,425 --> 00:07:28,113
of using Domain Storytelling we start with a happy path and then later look into a more complicated variations of the process

80
00:07:37,986 --> 00:07:45,411
So this little story and visualizing that story helped us to understand in much more detail 

81
00:07:45,555 --> 00:07:48,819
what the system was supposed to do

82
00:07:50,835 --> 00:07:56,451
and this is one of the typical cases for using Domain Storytelling to think about 

83
00:07:56,499 --> 00:08:01,731
new software systems and how they should support business processes

84
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:05,763
Now, how does this method work

85
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:12,147
Many people especially software developers tend to think about 

86
00:08:12,435 --> 00:08:16,371
business processes and visualize business processes like this 

87
00:08:17,187 --> 00:08:23,523
as a rather abstract but complete description of everything that could possibly happen 

88
00:08:23,907 --> 00:08:27,267
So it's about different paths in one picture 

89
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:31,395
With the main storytelling we choose a different approach 

90
00:08:31,683 --> 00:08:35,715
We think that a good example is better than a bad abstraction

91
00:08:35,907 --> 00:08:43,347
So we want examples first and from that knowledge from that foundation we can later build abstractions in our software

92
00:08:45,219 --> 00:08:56,499
so usual usually it's sufficient to model two or three of the most important versions of the business process so the happy path maybe an important variation or common error scenario 

93
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,859
so if we look at individual paths 

94
00:09:00,675 --> 00:09:05,907
and therefore we don't need any 

95
00:09:06,483 --> 00:09:12,195
any gateways or switches or ifs or case statements in our pictographic language

96
00:09:16,371 --> 00:09:18,915
Now domain stories can have different scopes 

97
00:09:19,731 --> 00:09:22,563
The story that I showed you about the construction site was 

98
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:27,219
I would say about medium on a medium level of detail 

99
00:09:27,555 --> 00:09:34,131
To give you some more idea how domain stories can can look I'll introduce you to another example 

100
00:09:34,371 --> 00:09:37,683
this time it's about a movie theater 

101
00:09:38,163 --> 00:09:43,539
so on the left side we see the process of going to the movies 

102
00:09:43,827 --> 00:09:49,491
so this is a end-to-end business process from the customer's point of view 

103
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:52,995
so we have a moviegoer here they buy a ticket 

104
00:09:53,283 --> 00:09:57,939
from a cashier and then you buy snacks and drinks from a concession stand

105
00:09:58,227 --> 00:10:04,419
and they showed a ticket to the usher to get access to the movie theater and so on

106
00:10:06,051 --> 00:10:11,379
On the right side we see a much more detailed picture 

107
00:10:11,571 --> 00:10:15,795
that tells you the story of buying tickets we have a moviegoer 

108
00:10:15,987 --> 00:10:20,595
who picks seats and buys for the tickets and so on 

109
00:10:21,651 --> 00:10:27,651
so time buying tickets was one step in the course grade story on the left 

110
00:10:27,891 --> 00:10:32,163
and it's now a whole story on its own in the more detailed story on the right 

111
00:10:32,346 --> 00:10:40,124
and that's just one way of illustrating different scopes of stories

112
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:48,908
now no matter the level of detail or the scope of the story you will always need a pictographic language to visualize it

113
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:56,876
So our pictographic language is comprised of a set of symbols

114
00:10:57,404 --> 00:11:04,604
So we have actors, the person or the people or the software systems

115
00:11:04,796 --> 00:11:07,340
who are active in the story who do things 

116
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:13,484
and we have work objects those are the things that they use it can be information, physical things

117
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:21,308
digital objects with activities depicted as arrows and we use textual annotations

118
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:30,332
now to give those icons a concrete meaning we label them so we have a customer ticket bias and so on 

119
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,268
and if we look at the pictographic language in a little bit more detail

120
00:11:34,796 --> 00:11:38,252
we can have for example different actors so most commonly 

121
00:11:38,636 --> 00:11:43,532
we use a single person, a group of people, a system but depending on the domain 

122
00:11:43,628 --> 00:11:47,276
that you're in you can change and adapt the set of symbols 

123
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,020
for example I did a couple of the main stories in 

124
00:11:52,892 --> 00:11:54,825
in the harbor domain

125
00:11:54,892 --> 00:12:00,028
so ships are important actors there and then have a little ship icon that represents a ship

126
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:06,940
 the same is true for the work objects we also use different icons there 

127
00:12:07,132 --> 00:12:11,404
most commonly to express the medium of a book object 

128
00:12:11,836 --> 00:12:20,380
so for example if I call the cashier in the box office of the cinema and ask about a reservation for a movie tonight

129
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:25,468
and then I would draw this with a telephone icon

130
00:12:25,948 --> 00:12:31,516
if they then send me a reservation as an email. I will use this email icon 

131
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:36,844
and if I decide to print the reservation at home. I will use the document icon 

132
00:12:38,236 --> 00:12:44,188
with that pictographic language we can build sentences and the idea is that 

133
00:12:44,284 --> 00:12:48,700
the sentence in the pictographic language reads almost like 

134
00:12:48,892 --> 00:12:52,348
you would write a natural language sentence 

135
00:12:53,452 --> 00:12:57,772
now to tell a story we of course need more than one sentence 

136
00:12:57,868 --> 00:13:05,884
So what do we do. We append sentences and we express the order by numbering them 

137
00:13:06,028 --> 00:13:09,340
So that's how you find your way through the domain story

138
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:17,836
now the pictographic language is just one aspect of the main storytelling 

139
00:13:18,604 --> 00:13:25,564
equally if not more important is that it is also a workshop format a way of bringing people together 

140
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,452
and what happens in the minds of the participants of the bookshop 

141
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,820
is very important so it's the picture is not just it's not the only result 

142
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:37,180
also being there being present in the workshop 

143
00:13:37,468 --> 00:13:43,180
if you miss this campfire experience it's not the same just looking at the result 

144
00:13:43,276 --> 00:13:46,060
showing the picture to someone who was not at a workshop

145
00:13:46,156 --> 00:13:49,036
that's not the same as actually being there and contributing to it

146
00:13:50,476 --> 00:13:55,852
so what do we need for a workshop. well we need people to tell us a story the story tells 

147
00:13:55,948 --> 00:14:01,084
and what is a storyteller without someone who listens so we need listeners 

148
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:07,084
our storytellers are usually the domain experts, users stakeholders 

149
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,260
and our listeners are usually members of a development team, 

150
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:16,156
business analysts, usability experts and so on.

151
00:14:16,444 --> 00:14:25,276
And often we don't have just one storyteller but we have several storytellers so every role that is involved in a business process can contribute to the story

152
00:14:28,012 --> 00:14:36,460
Now storytelling is not just a one-way activity. It's more of a dialogue of a discussion.

153
00:14:36,844 --> 00:14:42,412
So storytellers or domain experts are not always born storytellers

154
00:14:42,604 --> 00:14:46,108
so they needs a little help that's where moderator comes 

155
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:52,924
comes in handy and also the listeners can ask questions to move disturbing forward 

156
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:59,020
So typically we would ask what's happening next or how do you know that you have to do this now 

157
00:14:59,116 --> 00:15:04,108
or where do you get the information from to write it down somewhere and so on 

158
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:08,236
so we want the vivid conversation that moves forward 

159
00:15:08,284 --> 00:15:13,804
and while the story is told it is important that it is also visualized 

160
00:15:14,188 --> 00:15:20,425
and that's again a job that the moderator has 

161
00:15:20,476 --> 00:15:26,476
So we visualize the story using the pictographic language while it is told 

162
00:15:26,812 --> 00:15:29,740
so that gives everyone a chance to see if 

163
00:15:29,932 --> 00:15:33,580
we understood the story correctly or after any mistakes in it 

164
00:15:33,676 --> 00:15:39,052
so what will happen is that the domain experts so tell us say "oh no you missed a step" 

165
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:47,675
or "no that's not what I said I used a different word" or "can you draw the arrow to... can you turn it around this is wrong" 

166
00:15:48,273 --> 00:15:52,305
so this is very available and immediate feedback that we get 

167
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:58,833
for that to work everyone needs to be able to see the visualized story 

168
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:02,289
so we use tools for that for example we can use 

169
00:16:02,385 --> 00:16:06,129
whiteboards and sticky notes or digital blackboards 

170
00:16:06,225 --> 00:16:11,601
or we could use the tool that I used to show you 

171
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:17,025
the old work story it's called "Egon.io" it's open source runs in your browser 

172
00:16:17,169 --> 00:16:20,433
you can check it out egon.io is also the url. 

173
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:27,825
Now there's a lot more of course to discuss and learn about Domain Storytelling

174
00:16:29,975 --> 00:16:33,873
I've written a book about this method together with my colleague Henning Schwentner 

175
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:42,261
so if you are curious go and check out domainstorytelling.org you will find all sorts of links there including links to the book 

176
00:16:42,405 --> 00:16:48,525
and you can even save some money if you buy directly from Edison Wesley via the informant store

177
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:53,013
You can use this coupon code "DOMAINSTORY" and get a nice discount.

178
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:04,580
Now how has Domain Storytelling influenced DDD and how is DDD influenced Domain Storytelling 

179
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:08,811
Well, so far I haven't really talked about DDD. 

180
00:17:09,483 --> 00:17:15,387
In fact I've barely even talked about software or developing software or modeling software 

181
00:17:15,723 --> 00:17:18,267
and that is because Domain Storytelling 

182
00:17:18,507 --> 00:17:24,123
is a modeling method that helps you to have meaningful conversations about business processes 

183
00:17:24,267 --> 00:17:30,363
So building software for this processes is just one of many use cases for the main storytelling 

184
00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:33,937
you could use it to analyze weaknesses and problems 

185
00:17:33,937 --> 00:17:37,969
or you could use it to help newly hired employees to learn about your business 

186
00:17:38,065 --> 00:17:40,417
People do that and are happy with it.

187
00:17:41,953 --> 00:17:46,417
However I mostly use it in software development projects 

188
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:51,165
and there are some projects where I use Domain Storytelling like this

189
00:17:52,557 --> 00:17:55,485
so I would start with analyzing 

190
00:17:55,677 --> 00:17:59,901
the domain analyzing the problem spaced as-is situation 

191
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:04,941
modeling it together with the domain experts so they get a couple of domain stories out from that 

192
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:08,013
It is something that we can learn from get feedback from 

193
00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:13,245
We used it as a basis to design a new improved process software supported process 

194
00:18:13,681 --> 00:18:17,905
We model that with to-be domain stories that show us the future situation 

195
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:20,065
Again we get feedback from that 

196
00:18:20,353 --> 00:18:22,849
we use that to derive requirements 

197
00:18:22,993 --> 00:18:28,657
on a course grade or a medium grade level for example user stories or use cases 

198
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,545
and again we get feedback on those requirements 

199
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:37,633
and then we build software and of course we develop it iteratively and incrementally 

200
00:18:37,729 --> 00:18:41,665
that means we only take a couple of those requirements and refine them 

201
00:18:41,713 --> 00:18:44,785
and when you go to the next sprint iteration we take 

202
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:50,449
another set of requirements and refine them so it's a constant process of refinement 

203
00:18:51,649 --> 00:18:56,209
Now this process is or this description of software development

204
00:18:56,305 --> 00:19:00,961
is not entirely wrong but it's certainly not completely right 

205
00:19:02,161 --> 00:19:08,449
It's a bit too waterfally for me and that changed with domain driven design

206
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:13,297
In more and more of my projects, I get to use DDD. 

207
00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:18,433
And Eric Evans provided his own metaphor for the software development cycle. 

208
00:19:18,913 --> 00:19:24,673
That metaphor is the model exploration whirlpool and it looks like that.

209
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:35,137
So the whirlpool metaphor suggests that there are interconnected cycles of storytelling modeling and coding. 

210
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,929
And it is about learning and about making mistakes 

211
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:44,497
So we have activities that focus on housing and documenting, 

212
00:19:44,689 --> 00:19:48,001
scenarios and modeling them, telling stories, 

213
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,545
walking through them, refocus, 

214
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,569
proposing models, explore the language 

215
00:19:53,857 --> 00:19:58,993
and take those models turn them into code to learn from that experiment 

216
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:02,209
then go back to your scenarios

217
00:20:02,641 --> 00:20:06,625
and model more scenarios and other cases and so on 

218
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:09,169
So it's this constant whirlpool.

219
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:13,825
I think this model captures much better what is actually going on 

220
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:17,137
in a DDD style development project. 

221
00:20:17,713 --> 00:20:23,473
on the other hand this model is not as neat as the one I showed you before it looks a bit messy 

222
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:27,553
and maybe that is the reason why this metaphor is often 

223
00:20:27,745 --> 00:20:31,777
neglected. When people talk about DDD.

224
00:20:32,305 --> 00:20:34,465
Yet, I think the more... 

225
00:20:35,665 --> 00:20:40,801
The more I think about it. The more I reflect on it. The more powerful this metaphor becomes for me. 

226
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:44,881
And I mean it's easy to see that 

227
00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:50,353
When you highlight how often the term scenario or story appears 

228
00:20:50,497 --> 00:20:57,121
in the in the whirlpool that there's a connection to the main storytelling.

229
00:20:57,409 --> 00:20:58,925
So for me 

230
00:20:58,938 --> 00:21:02,922
Domain Storytelling fills this gap of how to actually 

231
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:07,866
gather my my scenarios how do I model them. 

232
00:21:08,922 --> 00:21:12,175
But how to return them? how bring...

233
00:21:12,175 --> 00:21:15,162
How do I bring them closer to developing software?

234
00:21:18,103 --> 00:21:25,399
So that's a way that Domain Storytelling can help with this model exploration whirlpool makes it more tangible 

235
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:28,663
but it also had an influence on Domain Storytelling 

236
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:33,031
because it helps me to better understand how to integrate 

237
00:21:33,127 --> 00:21:37,255
the main storytelling into the domain driven design process 

238
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:40,615
and it helps me to choose the right scope for a story 

239
00:21:40,711 --> 00:21:43,447
so which level of granularity am I interested in 

240
00:21:43,543 --> 00:21:45,925
Am I analyzing the current process 

241
00:21:45,925 --> 00:21:49,255
or am I deciding a new process and so on

242
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,848
so I think this is very helpful for that 

243
00:21:51,848 --> 00:21:54,344
for choosing the right scope of a story

244
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,288
now the second aspect that 

245
00:21:59,768 --> 00:22:03,176
has influenced the main storytelling and the development of the method 

246
00:22:03,272 --> 00:22:05,192
is collaborative modeling

247
00:22:06,872 --> 00:22:09,608
Before I became a DDD practitioner 

248
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:15,512
and a DDD coach I was active in the academic modeling community 

249
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,632
and the software and enterprise architecture communities 

250
00:22:18,776 --> 00:22:21,272
and in the requirements engineering community 

251
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,256
and I always felt a bit like an outsider. 

252
00:22:26,072 --> 00:22:31,064
And one of the reasons why this is different with the DDD community is that 

253
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:36,344
DDD practitioners have realized the value of collaborative modeling

254
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:44,072
While I had felt that for some time it really became evident to me 

255
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:50,600
At explore DDD conference in the U.S. where Paul Rayner drew this picture. 

256
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:55,335
It shows collaborative modeling is one of the most important concepts of DDD.

257
00:22:55,335 --> 00:22:56,679
It's one of its pillars 

258
00:22:56,871 --> 00:22:58,791
So I felt right at home, of course.

259
00:23:03,303 --> 00:23:05,463
While I'd felt that for some 

260
00:23:06,903 --> 00:23:12,327
time that collaborative modeling is 

261
00:23:13,047 --> 00:23:17,031
an important pillar of DDD 

262
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:21,975
I think that many people use it synonymously with 

263
00:23:22,023 --> 00:23:25,047
EventStorming ever since Alberto Brandolini came up with it. 

264
00:23:26,055 --> 00:23:29,943
So I use EventStorming too. Here you see my colleagues 

265
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,975
in a big picture EventStorming session 

266
00:23:34,286 --> 00:23:35,726
or some of my colleagues 

267
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,318
and I think of it as 

268
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,478
well I have a modeling toolbox 

269
00:23:40,574 --> 00:23:43,118
and in this toolbox there are several tools 

270
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:46,190
like EventStorming and Domain Storytelling 

271
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,598
and I think that 

272
00:23:49,934 --> 00:23:51,518
in many projects 

273
00:23:51,614 --> 00:23:54,734
you will have to use more than one modeling method 

274
00:23:54,878 --> 00:23:57,566
and you definitely have an advantage 

275
00:23:57,614 --> 00:24:00,590
if there are several tools in your toolbox and you know how to choose 

276
00:24:00,686 --> 00:24:03,518
between those tools and when to choose which tool 

277
00:24:03,566 --> 00:24:07,310
that will increase your changes your chance of success

278
00:24:09,422 --> 00:24:14,798
Now thinking of it as a toolbox is one way of seeing it 

279
00:24:15,374 --> 00:24:21,470
but I think collaborative modeling could also be described as a family of methods 

280
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:26,654
with different relationships between them and 

281
00:24:27,605 --> 00:24:32,405
the more I became experienced with DDD 

282
00:24:32,453 --> 00:24:37,061
and the more I looked at collaborative modeling as this family

283
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:42,485
So in my mind I would say that 

284
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:47,141
by now I see software development as a series of conversations 

285
00:24:47,189 --> 00:24:49,781
that are aided by modeling 

286
00:24:49,973 --> 00:24:56,309
with different members of this collaborative modeling family so with different tools 

287
00:24:58,469 --> 00:25:02,981
The community behind those methods or tools 

288
00:25:03,077 --> 00:25:04,997
They've started to write a book 

289
00:25:05,093 --> 00:25:09,701
called the Visual Collaboration Tools book you can find it on leanpub 

290
00:25:09,797 --> 00:25:11,429
and download it from there 

291
00:25:12,197 --> 00:25:14,789
so this is a really thriving community 

292
00:25:14,885 --> 00:25:19,973
and it's great to see that this family is ever expanding 

293
00:25:20,069 --> 00:25:23,477
and to see new connections made between those tools 

294
00:25:23,573 --> 00:25:27,893
So this is definitely something that has influenced me a lot

295
00:25:30,005 --> 00:25:33,461
Now the final thought I want to share with you today is 

296
00:25:34,757 --> 00:25:38,405
one of the most important concepts I think in DDD 

297
00:25:38,597 --> 00:25:42,725
and that is that language and models are bounded by their context 

298
00:25:43,637 --> 00:25:46,325
So this is really an eye opener

299
00:25:49,013 --> 00:25:53,093
I mean words can mean different things to different people, right. 

300
00:25:53,381 --> 00:25:58,613
So even if those people work in the same organization they might have different ideas 

301
00:25:58,709 --> 00:26:02,837
For example in our movie theater what could ticket mean 

302
00:26:02,933 --> 00:26:07,973
So for one person it could be a sellable unit that generates a profit 

303
00:26:08,117 --> 00:26:14,165
and for the other person it could mean a piece of paper that is validated in order to grant access to a movie theater.

304
00:26:14,837 --> 00:26:19,253
So if you look at this course-grade domain story from before again 

305
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:24,005
Cashier might think of the ticket as something that they sell it has a price and so on.

306
00:26:24,245 --> 00:26:26,885
and they are sure well they are not really interested in the price 

307
00:26:26,981 --> 00:26:31,781
they are just checking if it's the right date and time right movie and then the ground access 

308
00:26:31,973 --> 00:26:38,501
So they both say ticket but they mean different concepts when they mean "ticket". 

309
00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:42,581
Now this will often happen in 

310
00:26:43,013 --> 00:26:45,605
coarse-grained domain stories or also other 

311
00:26:45,653 --> 00:26:49,157
collaborative modelling techniques that when you have different stakeholders 

312
00:26:49,253 --> 00:26:52,661
to use the same terms without meaning exactly the same thing. 

313
00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:55,685
and this is not necessarily a problem 

314
00:26:55,925 --> 00:26:57,893
especially on this coarse-grained level. 

315
00:26:57,893 --> 00:27:03,125
but I'll I want to show you an example where it really was a problem for me 

316
00:27:03,182 --> 00:27:07,694
to moderate the modeling session 

317
00:27:07,838 --> 00:27:10,574
because there was an immediate problem 

318
00:27:11,275 --> 00:27:15,854
that luckily I could resolve with the help of bounded contexts 

319
00:27:16,842 --> 00:27:22,938
So this is yet another domain that tell you about this time it's a 

320
00:27:24,522 --> 00:27:27,882
fixtures company called awesome browser games 

321
00:27:27,882 --> 00:27:33,018
so a company that provides a platform for playing browser games 

322
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:35,249
but it's based on a true story

323
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:41,345
so in the workshop in a real workshop we got different people from different departments together 

324
00:27:41,441 --> 00:27:43,313
domain expert, software developers 

325
00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:46,913
and we wanted to start with a course-grained domain story 

326
00:27:47,009 --> 00:27:49,553
that shows us an end-to-end process 

327
00:27:49,649 --> 00:27:55,073
so a first-time user signs up plays their first game gets built for the game 

328
00:27:56,273 --> 00:28:02,369
So someone started and say well the first step is that the user opens an account with awesome browser games 

329
00:28:02,465 --> 00:28:05,489
and immediately someone said no 

330
00:28:05,681 --> 00:28:10,529
they said no the account is much, is created much later, I know that for a fact 

331
00:28:10,865 --> 00:28:13,409
but the first person replied no no no no 

332
00:28:13,601 --> 00:28:17,873
you are wrong this is the first step I know it I know that for a fact 

333
00:28:17,969 --> 00:28:20,801
this is the first thing that we do we open the account

334
00:28:23,441 --> 00:28:28,625
well in the words of Rartin Fowler 

335
00:28:29,105 --> 00:28:32,945
"A single conceptual model is a tricky beast to work with" 

336
00:28:33,185 --> 00:28:37,985
and that was what we were trying to do here build a single conceptual model 

337
00:28:38,081 --> 00:28:42,209
for terms that could not be reconciled

338
00:28:43,601 --> 00:28:50,177
so bounded contexts to the rescue what did we do to resolve this situation move on forward 

339
00:28:51,425 --> 00:28:54,497
well I said okay let's assume for a moment that 

340
00:28:54,689 --> 00:29:00,257
the first person is right and that the account is open in the first step and then the continued modeling 

341
00:29:00,353 --> 00:29:04,529
and eventually arrived at the step here the step five in the picture 

342
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:07,937
where the second person thinks that their account is created 

343
00:29:07,985 --> 00:29:11,489
and we used different icons to show that 

344
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:15,617
we mean different things here so different kinds of accounts possibly 

345
00:29:15,857 --> 00:29:19,169
and when we talked about it it became evident 

346
00:29:19,361 --> 00:29:24,065
that one person thought about 

347
00:29:24,209 --> 00:29:28,049
the account in the context of use user registration 

348
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,497
and the other person 

349
00:29:30,737 --> 00:29:34,433
was thinking about accounts in the context of 

350
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:36,737
what we call the game management 

351
00:29:36,881 --> 00:29:39,425
so there are actually two kinds of accounts here. 

352
00:29:40,001 --> 00:29:45,275
one that are per user and the other one is per user and per game 

353
00:29:45,275 --> 00:29:50,033
so if you play different games you have different accounts one for each game 

354
00:29:50,796 --> 00:29:53,532
So luckily we had this 

355
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:57,948
concept of bounded context that helped us to resolve this issue 

356
00:29:58,188 --> 00:30:03,200
otherwise I don't think the workshop would have been a success but with this 

357
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,988
revelation and we could move on forward and had a successful workshop 

358
00:30:09,852 --> 00:30:15,036
and actually you can use this kind of differences in languages to 

359
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,889
spot and find and identify bounded context 

360
00:30:18,889 --> 00:30:23,580
so that's also a way how we use Domain Storytelling for finding bounded contexts 

361
00:30:25,132 --> 00:30:29,068
You've actually seen another example already where 

362
00:30:29,164 --> 00:30:32,908
we used bounded context and we remodeled them in a domain story 

363
00:30:33,004 --> 00:30:35,548
and that was of course the cinema example 

364
00:30:36,124 --> 00:30:42,172
So again on the left in the coursed-grain story we see in the rectangles different contexts 

365
00:30:42,316 --> 00:30:45,724
So we have ticket sales and snack sales and entrance control 

366
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,700
and in the more detailed domain story 

367
00:30:48,796 --> 00:30:53,740
that story plays within one context within the ticket sales context 

368
00:30:53,836 --> 00:30:56,716
and of course we want to make sure that within the ticket sales context 

369
00:30:56,812 --> 00:31:02,332
we have the same idea of the of the terms that are used there so 

370
00:31:02,428 --> 00:31:04,924
that we need our ubiquitous language right

371
00:31:07,612 --> 00:31:11,308
So these are the three things where I think 

372
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:14,620
DDD has really influenced Domain Storytelling 

373
00:31:14,716 --> 00:31:18,844
and influenced its development and also my personal modeling practices 

374
00:31:19,132 --> 00:31:21,772
So we have this idea of the model exploration whirlpool 

375
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:26,956
a powerful metaphor a bit neglected in the DDD community sadly 

376
00:31:27,244 --> 00:31:31,925
and we have this this big big community of collaborative modeling 

377
00:31:31,925 --> 00:31:36,700
that is not only within DDD but also extending to other communities 

378
00:31:36,796 --> 00:31:38,860
like behavior different development for example

379
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:45,244
and we have this game-changing concept of bounded context 

380
00:31:45,292 --> 00:31:48,268
so the idea that language and models are bounded by the context 

381
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:51,292
that really changed my modeling practices.

382
00:31:53,308 --> 00:31:56,428
Now if you want to know more about Domain Storytelling 

383
00:31:56,524 --> 00:31:59,164
go check out domainstorytelling.org 

384
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,852
You will find my slides on speaker deck 

385
00:32:01,948 --> 00:32:05,740
and now I'm looking forward for your questions, thank you.

386
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:12,412
Okay thank you very much about Dr. Stefan Hofer's sharing.

387
00:32:12,508 --> 00:32:17,452
and right now let me see what's question that the participants asked.

388
00:32:29,116 --> 00:32:33,244
so there are a lot of questions on slido right 

389
00:32:34,108 --> 00:32:38,908
Yeah! okay. Can you see my screen? 

390
00:32:38,908 --> 00:32:40,204
Yes, I can. 

391
00:32:41,308 --> 00:32:44,428
Okay the first question is 

392
00:32:44,572 --> 00:32:48,796
I saw there is no round-trip between each components, 

393
00:32:48,892 --> 00:32:51,868
could you tell us what motivated you to 

394
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:58,588
create this 1-way direction to express the message flow?

395
00:33:00,508 --> 00:33:04,492
So I think this question refers to the 

396
00:33:04,636 --> 00:33:08,000
roadwork construction example that I gave 

397
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,628
if I'm correct 

398
00:33:10,348 --> 00:33:14,284
um yeah so um  

399
00:33:14,476 --> 00:33:18,460
This is something very typical for software developers 

400
00:33:18,556 --> 00:33:22,684
we often think in this kind of request response 

401
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:28,492
a pattern um or yeah or like you 

402
00:33:28,732 --> 00:33:33,580
you call a method and then you get a return value or something like that 

403
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:38,140
I mean you can use the main storytelling in that way 

404
00:33:38,188 --> 00:33:41,692
but often I think it's the better idea to 

405
00:33:41,836 --> 00:33:44,524
to use it to express an intention. 

406
00:33:44,908 --> 00:33:49,372
otherwise the the picture becomes very messy with a lot of 

407
00:33:49,468 --> 00:33:53,212
back and forth, and back and forth, and back and forth without really gaining 

408
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,996
without pushing the story forward 

409
00:33:56,044 --> 00:33:59,020
so the idea is that you express intention 

410
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:01,948
and not necessarily things like

411
00:34:02,925 --> 00:34:06,796
you know you enter something in the system in the web page you press the button 

412
00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:11,937
and then the web page renders a new html page and then you press the next button 

413
00:34:11,985 --> 00:34:14,385
and then it renders a new html page 

414
00:34:14,481 --> 00:34:16,881
this would be very boring that's not a good story 

415
00:34:16,977 --> 00:34:22,257
there's not a lot of information in it that's that drives the conversation forward

416
00:34:22,353 --> 00:34:26,875
so that's what I want to avoid and I focus more on 

417
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:28,975
what is the intention of this step 

418
00:34:28,975 --> 00:34:34,113
and then it's okay to have just a one-way information flow 

419
00:34:34,209 --> 00:34:35,745
or one way direction 

420
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:39,009
yeah so that's that's the idea. 

421
00:34:39,853 --> 00:34:42,301
Okay, thank you for your answer.

422
00:34:42,397 --> 00:34:44,413
And the second question is  

423
00:34:47,025 --> 00:34:51,373
have you ever met someone asking about the compression 

424
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:54,925
between domain story telling and even storming? 

425
00:34:55,021 --> 00:34:56,797
How do you think about it?

426
00:34:57,901 --> 00:35:00,397
Again that is a very common question 

427
00:35:00,493 --> 00:35:03,277
and as you saw in the in the slides

428
00:35:03,277 --> 00:35:06,075
I put one picture of our event stopping session in there 

429
00:35:06,075 --> 00:35:08,029
that I facilitated 

430
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:10,813
so I use both methods 

431
00:35:10,861 --> 00:35:12,349
plus many more 

432
00:35:12,397 --> 00:35:14,701
I would say for the last 

433
00:35:14,845 --> 00:35:20,701
three years or so I've used event storming and Domain Storytelling about

434
00:35:20,749 --> 00:35:25,261
to the same amount like 50 50 something like that

435
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,649
there is an overlap 

436
00:35:29,649 --> 00:35:29,675
there are situations where you can use one or the other and will still get a good result out of it 

437
00:35:29,675 --> 00:35:36,081
there are situations where you can use one or the other and will still get a good result out of it 

438
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:40,000
but there are also situations where I think one is better than the other 

439
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,958
and one of the indicators for me is 

440
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:46,941
what is this process about or 

441
00:35:46,941 --> 00:35:47,018
what information are you looking to 

442
00:35:47,018 --> 00:35:50,781
what information are you looking to 

443
00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:53,085
to learn what what are interested in 

444
00:35:53,229 --> 00:35:57,549
if it's about many people collaborating with each other 

445
00:35:57,645 --> 00:35:59,565
so if you have a business process it involves 

446
00:35:59,661 --> 00:36:02,493
many people or even many software systems 

447
00:36:02,589 --> 00:36:05,565
and information goes from one person to the next and back 

448
00:36:05,661 --> 00:36:08,397
and you're interested in the communication patterns 

449
00:36:08,493 --> 00:36:11,421
and and learning how people collaborate 

450
00:36:11,613 --> 00:36:12,765
then I think 

451
00:36:12,861 --> 00:36:16,137
Domain Storytelling is the better approach 

452
00:36:16,137 --> 00:36:19,965
because the story is centered around the the people around the actors 

453
00:36:20,073 --> 00:36:22,665
and you can really see who is doing what 

454
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:23,913
with whom 

455
00:36:24,537 --> 00:36:27,850
if on the other hand you're more interested in this time series 

456
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:32,073
like in evenstorming you have this timeline from left to right 

457
00:36:32,217 --> 00:36:34,089
and status changes 

458
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,800
and this happened better and that happened that happened 

459
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,857
then event storming is is I think the better approach 

460
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:43,161
but as I said um 

461
00:36:43,257 --> 00:36:47,913
I use I use both there are situations where you can use both 

462
00:36:48,009 --> 00:36:49,929
and you can also combine it

463
00:36:50,073 --> 00:36:55,689
for example in the project that I'm currently working on 

464
00:36:55,833 --> 00:37:00,441
we started with Domain Storytelling to figure out the the process 

465
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:02,409
that this new software system should build 

466
00:37:02,505 --> 00:37:08,265
and then the development team decided they want to implement the software using event sourcing 

467
00:37:08,697 --> 00:37:12,777
so for big picture level we had domain stories 

468
00:37:12,825 --> 00:37:16,281
and for design level for the system design 

469
00:37:16,377 --> 00:37:22,953
we switched to event storming because it fits much better to an event-sourced way of building systems 

470
00:37:24,489 --> 00:37:29,193
there are more ways to combine it I have to refer you to the book for that 

471
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,593
we have a couple of examples there 

472
00:37:31,689 --> 00:37:34,953
yeah so 

473
00:37:34,953 --> 00:37:36,950
Okay, thank you very much. 

474
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:39,945
Okay, the third question is 

475
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:43,977
can Domain Storytelling be used as a methodlogy 

476
00:37:44,073 --> 00:37:49,977
or a tool for class design in the impolementation of DDD tactical design?

477
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:57,609
I think there was a follow-up from 

478
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,161
Kim in the in the chat 

479
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,350
so it depends on different perspective and how much focus you're looking 

480
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:09,453
for in time series consequences or the actors relationships yes yes I think that's right 

481
00:38:10,287 --> 00:38:12,063
that's uh it's a good summary 

482
00:38:12,399 --> 00:38:14,511
Okay now to the next question sorry. 

483
00:38:14,607 --> 00:38:18,735
So can the Domain Storytelling be used as a methodology or a tool for class design.

484
00:38:18,783 --> 00:38:20,655
Yes, it can.

485
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,879
The funny thing about it is that 

486
00:38:25,247 --> 00:38:29,567
Domain Storytelling well its predecessors are actually rather old 

487
00:38:29,663 --> 00:38:35,759
so the first ancestor the first predecessor is from the 1990s 

488
00:38:35,903 --> 00:38:40,175
and it was heavily influenced by object oriented modeling 

489
00:38:40,607 --> 00:38:44,255
so you can still still see that influence and 

490
00:38:44,351 --> 00:38:49,967
I think it is suitable as a tool for class modeling 

491
00:38:50,063 --> 00:38:53,999
when you want an object oriented approach 

492
00:38:54,383 --> 00:38:58,511
and it also fits nicely into the the DDD thinking 

493
00:38:58,607 --> 00:39:02,111
because you can look at the work objects and say okay 

494
00:39:02,255 --> 00:39:08,207
this is going to be either an entity or aggregate or maybe a value object 

495
00:39:08,399 --> 00:39:11,231
and the arrows that depict the activities 

496
00:39:11,279 --> 00:39:14,735
well those are the um 

497
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,335
that is the behavior of the entities and the work objects 

498
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:21,071
so for example 

499
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:27,119
in this construction example we had permits and we had hearings 

500
00:39:27,311 --> 00:39:32,543
and the hearing was started then statements um are considered 

501
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:37,055
and these are all the things that later become entities and aggregates 

502
00:39:37,151 --> 00:39:40,751
so a hearing for example we model the hearing as an aggregate 

503
00:39:40,895 --> 00:39:44,975
and and stuff like that so that works 

504
00:39:44,975 --> 00:39:48,863
What do you need for that you need Domain Storytelling that you. 

505
00:39:48,911 --> 00:39:51,650
Sorry, you need domain stories that are rather fine-grained 

506
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:55,343
so if you're on a very overview level this wouldn't work 

507
00:39:55,631 --> 00:39:59,231
but if if you model it rather fine-drained 

508
00:39:59,327 --> 00:40:04,367
then you have enough language and enough expressiveness in the model 

509
00:40:04,463 --> 00:40:07,871
that you can defer object-oriented design from that

510
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,663
Okay, thank you very much.

511
00:40:11,855 --> 00:40:14,063
and the next question is 

512
00:40:14,399 --> 00:40:19,199
Domain Storytelling as a methodology of implementing DDD 

513
00:40:19,295 --> 00:40:24,911
what do you think is advantage? and what about the disadvantage?

514
00:40:31,247 --> 00:40:37,535
Most of the time I used Domain Storytelling as a communication tool 

515
00:40:37,631 --> 00:40:39,311
and the thing that is 

516
00:40:39,407 --> 00:40:43,075
apart from what I just explained from that from the previous question with

517
00:40:43,075 --> 00:40:44,879
how you can use it to implement it 

518
00:40:45,071 --> 00:40:47,039
but mostly um 

519
00:40:47,183 --> 00:40:51,119
I think it's about bringing people people together 

520
00:40:51,263 --> 00:40:55,439
having meaningful conversations about the domain 

521
00:40:55,535 --> 00:41:00,959
and that is something that Domain Storytelling is uh really good at helping with this 

522
00:41:01,055 --> 00:41:04,127
so this would be the the main advantage 

523
00:41:04,223 --> 00:41:05,951
and um 

524
00:41:06,623 --> 00:41:12,100
then you can drive the conversation into different directions for example you can use it to find uh 

525
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:16,000
bounded contexts so that would be a typical way of using it 

526
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,425
uh to implement DDD 

527
00:41:18,482 --> 00:41:20,930
or you can use it on a lower level 

528
00:41:21,825 --> 00:41:24,722
to to come up with object oriented 

529
00:41:24,722 --> 00:41:27,890
design using entities and aggregates and so on 

530
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,625
What about disadvantages? 

531
00:41:31,795 --> 00:41:37,987
Well I'm a bit biased here of course I really love Domain Storytelling so

532
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:42,787
it's it's hard to think about disadvantages but 

533
00:41:44,275 --> 00:41:46,195
now with the feedback 

534
00:41:47,635 --> 00:41:52,579
Okay, but well maybe let's put it this way 

535
00:41:52,675 --> 00:41:55,507
It's not the right tool for everything 

536
00:41:55,795 --> 00:41:59,059
So that's why I always talk about this toolbox 

537
00:41:59,299 --> 00:42:04,147
and I've had situations where 

538
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:08,851
I thought using this this modeling method is a good idea 

539
00:42:08,947 --> 00:42:11,971
and then we go into the workshop and it just doesn't work 

540
00:42:12,067 --> 00:42:14,625
for some reason for for whatever reason 

541
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:18,550
and then it's always good if you have this toolbox of other modeling tools and say 

542
00:42:18,606 --> 00:42:21,630
okay I'm sorry this conversation is not going forward 

543
00:42:21,726 --> 00:42:23,310
but I have an idea

544
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:25,710
let's use for example 

545
00:42:25,806 --> 00:42:29,262
let's use example mapping to to to figure that out or 

546
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:31,470
let's use event storming and then you can switch 

547
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:35,358
so I think this would be a disadvantage like 

548
00:42:35,454 --> 00:42:40,110
treating it as a one-size-fits-all tool for every situation that's not going to work 

549
00:42:40,206 --> 00:42:45,534
you you will need different tools in your toolbox

550
00:42:48,606 --> 00:42:51,870
Okay and the next is

551
00:42:51,966 --> 00:42:58,494
Domain Storytelling suitable as a DDD implementation method in complex domain 

552
00:42:58,638 --> 00:43:02,574
such as the banking or financial industry.

553
00:43:04,686 --> 00:43:07,854
Yes, I think so that it's suitable for complex domains

554
00:43:10,075 --> 00:43:12,942
my colleagues and I have have used this technique 

555
00:43:13,038 --> 00:43:15,102
and its predecessors for 

556
00:43:15,472 --> 00:43:18,976
uh 15 years and we applied it in 

557
00:43:19,168 --> 00:43:22,048
complex domains like healthcare, 

558
00:43:22,192 --> 00:43:24,736
banking, insurance 

559
00:43:28,825 --> 00:43:31,120
managing ports for example 

560
00:43:31,925 --> 00:43:34,624
we had stuff like 

561
00:43:34,995 --> 00:43:39,843
disaster management disaster disaster response teams 

562
00:43:39,939 --> 00:43:44,499
so a whole lot of different domains logistics of course 

563
00:43:44,595 --> 00:43:48,819
e-commerce so it's not really 

564
00:43:48,915 --> 00:43:52,035
bound to one domain it's really for for 

565
00:43:52,131 --> 00:43:53,715
pretty much every domain 

566
00:43:53,859 --> 00:43:58,371
so I have not encountered a domain yet where I say okay this doesn't fit here 

567
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:04,275
yeah so I would definitely to say this is usable in complex domains 

568
00:44:06,051 --> 00:44:09,603
Okay, thank you for your presentation 

569
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:14,643
Have you run into a suitable where one object 

570
00:44:14,691 --> 00:44:17,427
can either be a working object 

571
00:44:17,523 --> 00:44:22,467
or an actor in different sequence of one DST image? 

572
00:44:22,563 --> 00:44:24,531
How do we deal with it? 

573
00:44:25,779 --> 00:44:29,811
That's a good question. It's already a bit advanced 

574
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,795
so well 

575
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:36,915
Within the domain, of course, it can happen that.

576
00:44:38,225 --> 00:44:43,625
in in one domain story something is an actor and in one domain is something is a work object. 

577
00:44:43,731 --> 00:44:46,755
similarly to in in one bounded context

578
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:49,059
you can model something as an entity 

579
00:44:49,107 --> 00:44:53,043
and in the next bounded context it's a value object because it doesn't change 

580
00:44:53,379 --> 00:44:55,107
so that's possible 

581
00:44:55,203 --> 00:44:58,803
but this question is about in the same picture in the same domain

582
00:45:00,675 --> 00:45:05,379
again this is not a common case but it can happen 

583
00:45:05,523 --> 00:45:08,454
for example um 

584
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:10,854
if we think about something like 

585
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:15,126
user management, user registration you sign up for something 

586
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:17,094
you are the user you're the actor then 

587
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:18,342
I'm only as an actor 

588
00:45:18,438 --> 00:45:19,686
and you open your account 

589
00:45:19,782 --> 00:45:21,606
and then the system

590
00:45:21,702 --> 00:45:24,630
creates a user as a representation 

591
00:45:24,726 --> 00:45:27,174
of the of the human being 

592
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:29,190
then we have 

593
00:45:29,286 --> 00:45:33,846
user as an actor and then we have user as a work object with the same picture 

594
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:36,582
but that's not a problem at all 

595
00:45:36,678 --> 00:45:39,510
you just have to use a different icon 

596
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:40,950
to represent that. 

597
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:45,990
So I would use this little stick figure for the for the actor for the person 

598
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:52,518
and for example the icon set that I use that's the google material I can set 

599
00:45:53,175 --> 00:45:58,230
they have another smaller picture of a user with a little check mark 

600
00:45:58,326 --> 00:46:01,800
and that's the one that I typically use for stuff like 

601
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,576
um user account

602
00:46:04,925 --> 00:46:08,771
So that's that's the way how I deal with it.

603
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:12,050
So use different icons to represent those different concepts 

604
00:46:12,446 --> 00:46:13,646
and then it works.

605
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,278
Okay!

606
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:26,174
as the realization of products or services, 

607
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:31,214
what methodologies or tool does Domain Storytelling usually integrate

608
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:35,630
with to form a complete agile development process 

609
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:39,470
from requirements analysis to system development

610
00:46:40,526 --> 00:46:44,453
um very nice so um

611
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:53,343
one of the tools of the methods that I use 

612
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:57,509
um a lot in combination with Domain Storytelling

613
00:46:57,605 --> 00:46:59,813
is user story mapping 

614
00:47:00,629 --> 00:47:01,550
why 

615
00:47:02,625 --> 00:47:05,350
because of two reasons so

616
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:14,825
Domain Storytelling is always about scenarios so about typically
