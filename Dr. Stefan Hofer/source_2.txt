Hello Taiwan
My name is Jeff and Hoover
And I love a good story
To imagine
It is 20000 years ago
Listen to middle of winter
And the tribe of tastes people sit around a won't fire
It is quiet except for the cracking firewood
Did one of the elders Christian throat
Many summers ago
A lot of Pies on the Wonder through our hunting grounds
Across the largest heard that anyone had ever seen
And as to Elda she has a story one of the People starts to use colorful rocks and coal
To paint a picture
And to this everyday
We can see this picture in the capable
Innocence that is what we want to do with the main storytelling
Columbus Park of Fire
Tell a story and paint a picture
Storytelling is at the heart of human communication
And it still works and HR software
Main storytelling is one of the techniques that brings domain experts
Put up Elmo's business analyst in software development teams together
It helps them to overcome misunderstandings
Interested, language to helps you to talk about business processes and requirements
French short built better business software
Today I'm going to introduce you to domain storytelling by showing you a short stay mode
Tenable explain the method and finally I will tell you a little bit about the influence that.
Fidgety head-on
How to make storytelling and maybe also the inference that
DDS
DDD and its community
So I will tell you another story
This time it is about a softer system
That my colleagues and I built a couple of years
I go
It's a softer system that was
Supposed to help approve road work
So what happened was with a group of stakeholders and they already had a set of requirements
Just had all the system must support issuing permits
Enthesitis system must support hearings and we need support and reviewing applications and
Many more use cases
So the problem was that we didn't really understand how old is
Isolated requirements make up a whole software system 44 proofing rotruck we hadn't really understood
Basic business processes behind it
So how does
Approving vote that typically work
Pickles two questions
That we asked our domain experts from reporting together in a room
And in front of whiteboard
And Tim just as the story to told us
Sol Construction Company
Has Walnut tender for a whole book project
Before they can start still need to obtain a permit so that they can close the road to traffic
Soda story
Starts with the project supervisor at what's the contract to the construction company
And then they can submit application for the permit using this new software system that we were supposed to build
Now the stakeholders told us that the project supervisor should be notified whenever you
Application comes in because they need to leave your application and compare it
With the tender documents and we didn't understand that requirement at first
And they explained why Latham Dikembe flick sample different dates in
Application then independent documents if for example the
A construction company and doesn't have the necessary resources or maybe the weather has trained
Then they need to delay the construction work and that's why dates quotes differ
Indication for the permit and independent documents
So once the application is a Butte
Another role comes into play a traffic Authority
They dropped the permit
And stay determined the concerned authorities for a hearing
So concerned authorities
Those are for example police communities public transport everyone who could be affected by construct
Auction site and think it a link to the hearing documents
And can review their permit
And they can submit statements what is a attitude okay or they can raise concerns
Maybe there's another phone plans or something like that would have some influence on their
So the testicles are with you then consider these statements and issues to permit
And the permit has been sent to the construction company
Not this whole healing process here and drafting the
Permit
And revising the draft considering statements made by the concerned authorities
That is something that can be repeated several times
I'm Puttin this story block that I happy path scenario so everything is fine
The first draft becomes 25 permit
Anthem
This is often typical
A way of using domain storytelling we start with a Happy Paws and then later look into
I'm more complicated
Variations of the process
So this little story and visualizing that stories helped us to understand
Much more detail
I'm watched assistant was supposed to do
And this is one of the typical cases for using the main storytelling to think about
Ubisoft assistance and how they shoot
Supportassist process
How does this method work
Many people especially software developers tend to think about
Business processes and visualize business processes like this
S
Radha abstract
But
Complete description of everything that could possibly happen
So it's about
Different Pops in one picture
But the main story telling me choose a different approach
Do you think that a good example
It's better than a badass traction so we won't examples first and from that Knowledge from the temptation
Lace-up.
Spectrum signal software
So usually usually sufficient tomorrow to or three of the most important persons after business process so they happy
Even important Iration well come on Everson
So we look at individual house
And
Therefore we don't need any
Any gateways or switches or it's okay statements and I'll pictographic language
Nevermind stove is connected from Scopes
I just needed a shoulder about the construction site was
I would say about medium on a medium level of detail
To give you some more idea how to Main Service can can look
How would you say to another example
This time it's about a movie theater
So on left side with c
The process of going to the movies
So this is
End-to-end business process
From the customers point of view
We have a moviegoer here
To buy a ticket
Soma Kesha and then you buy snacks and drinks from a concession stand and it showed a ticket to
To get access to the movie theater and Swan
On the right side we see a much more detailed
Picture
Chelsea just OB
Buying tickets with a movie go up
Cool
Exceeds and Tobias for the tickets and 21
So tight buy tickets one-step in cross-grain story on the left
And it's not a whole story on its own and then we'll teach her story on the right
That's just
One Way Out
Illustrating different scopes of stories
Don't know Melody level of detail the scope of the story you always need a pictographic language
Two people Isaac
So our pictographic language is
Comprised of
Set of symbols
So weird actors
The person
People are the subsystems
Who asked for the stormy who do things
And fifth look up shirts
Those are the things that they use
Canby Mason physical things
Dick Trickle objects
With activities
Deepika caseros
A textual invitation
How to get dos
I can secrete meaning we label them
So whatever customer tickets by since 1
And if you look at the picture graphic language in a little bit more detail
We can have foot simple different access to most commonly
Single person group of people system but depending on the domain that you're in you can
Changing a set of symbols
For example I did a couple of two main service in
How about the main ships and pork neck to stand that has little ship item that represents
Battleship
The same is true for the book upstairs
We also use different I can stare
What's comalito
Expressive medium of a backup track
Tupac sampled
I called the cashier in the Box Office of the cinema and ask about reservation for
A movie tonight
Instant Hotel draw this with our telephone
Item
If they didn't sent me a reservation as an email I will use to seem like him
And if I decide to Prince the reservation at home I will use the document.
Recette pictographic language
We can build sentences
Anti-theist
The sentence
In the pictographic language reads almost like
You would write a natural
Language sentence
How to tell a story we have cost more than one sentence so what do we do
Penned sentences
Andre Express to order a number Indian
So that's how you find your way to the main story
Touted pictographic language is just one aspect of the main storytelling
Equally if not more important is that it is also a workshop
We're speaking people together
Happens in the minds of two participants of the Bookshop
I'm just very important so it's the picture Snapchat
It's not the only result
Also being there being present in the workshop
Euphemistic campfire experience it's not the same just looking at the result
Showing picture to someone who was not at the Bookshop that's not the same as actually being there contributing to it
So what do we need for Workshop well we need people to tell us a story.
And what is a Storyteller without someone who listens
You need to listen us
I'll stay hotels are usually the domain experts
Uses
Stakeholders
And I'll listen to say usually members of a development team
I'm business analysts
Usability experts in Suwanee
And often we don't have just one Storyteller but we're supposed to tell so every road is involved in a business
Process can contribute to the story
Storytelling is not just
One-way activity
It's more of a dialogue of a discussion
So
Stamatelos what domain experts are not ogres born storytellers
So they didn't even go help that's what motivated comes
Comes in handy and also to listeners can
Ask questions to move to still before but
So typically we would ask
What's happening next
Well how do you know that you have to do this now
Where'd you get your information from
Strong budget down somewhere
And Salon
So we don't have a conversation that moves or what
And while the story is told it is important that it is also visualized
Chocolate
Motivator
Has
So we visualize the story using the pictographic language
While it is told
Everyone a chance to see if
We understood the story correctly or any mistakes
So what will happen is that the domain experts so tell us a Ono you missed a step
Oh no that's not what I said I used two different word or can you draw the arrow to kill tonight around
This is wrong
So this is available and immediate feedback
For that to work everyone needs to be able to see the
The Last Story
So we use tools for that for example we can use
Whiteboards and sticky notes or digital blackboards
Or we could use
The tool that I used to show you the
Holbrook story is called Egan IO its open-source Ramsey new browser
Check it out you can dial salsa de UL
Now that's a lot more of course to discuss and learn about the main storytelling
African a book about this semester together with my colleague heading shrimp
So if you are curious go and check out stomach still attending. Org you will find
All sorts of things to include links to the book and you can even save some money if your part directly from
We had an informant store
Can use this coupon code to main story get an ice disc
How has
Domain storytelling
Insensitivity and how is t2d influence domain storytelling
So far I haven't really talked about
DDD
Success
Belly from top to bottom
Software development software modeling software
And that is because domain storytelling
It's a mothering mess with that helps you to have meaningful conversations about business processes
The billing software for this process is just one of many use cases for the Main Street
You could use it to enter last weaknesses and problems or you could use it to help newly hired employees to learn about
Business
People do that
And you're happy with it
However I mostly use it in software development projects
And there are some portraits we're used to make storytelling like this
So I would stop with analyzing
But the main analyzing the problem space to is is
Situation
Modeling it together with the domain experts to get a couple of the main stories out from that
It is something that we can learn from Conceited from
Can you sit as a basis to design a new windproof process software supported process
The model that was to be two main service that shows the future situation
I didn't forget seat back from that
Are you set to dehart requirements
Coarse grained remedium quaint level Forks a user stories
Are use cases
Anna Kendrick
Requirements
And thank you both software and tacos with development attractively in its mentally
That means we only take a couple of those requirements and refine them
And Anna go to next Sprint activation will take another set of requirements and refine them so
It's a constant process of
Refinement
That this process is what is description of of software development
It's not entirely wrong but it's certainly not completely right
It sucks
To Walter for me for me and that changed with the main room design
Mon mothma portraits I get to use dd&a Kevin's provided his own metaphor for the song
Software development cycle
That metaphor is the model exploration whirlpool and it looks like that
Soda volt pool metaphor suggests that there are interconnected cycles of Storytelling
Modeling and coding
And it's about learning and about making mistakes
So we have activities that focus on housing and documenting scenarios and
Modeling time telling stories
Booking through them refocus
Posing models Exploder language
Handsome
Take those models turned into cold learn from that experiment then go back to your scenarios and
Modern War scenarios and other cases and so on
What does constant whirlpool
I think this mobile captures much better but it's actually going on
And DDD style development project
Ariana anstice model is not as neat as 21-02 before it's looks a bit messy
And maybe that is the reason why this mess metaphor is often
Neglected when people talk about DDD
I think the more
The more I think about it tomorrow reflects a little more powerful this metaphor becomes for me
And I mean it's easy to see
That
Can you highlight how often the term scenario still reappears
In the whirlpool
That there's a connection to domain storytelling
So for me
Tomato telling feels to step of how to actually
Gotta
My my scenarios how do I model them
How to return them
Hoping to bring them closer to developing software
So that's a way that students Hotel you can help with this more exploration Whirlpool makes it more
Tangible
But it also the influence on domain storytelling
Because it helps me to better understand how to integrate
Donate storytelling into that domain driven design process
And it helps me to choose the right
Scope for Stoney so which level of penalty am I interested in
I'm analyzing the process or deciding a new process and so on
So I think this is very helpful for that
Choosing the right scope of a story
As aspect that
Has influence the main storytelling and development of the method is collaborative modeling
Before became a DDD practitioner
Coach
I was active in the academic modeling community
And a soft one Enterprise architecture communities
At the end of the climate Center even community
And I always felt a bit like an outsider
And one of two reasons
Why does is different if the DVD Community is that DDD practitioners
Realize the value of collaborative modeling
While I had felt it for some time will it became evident to me
Ads
Exploded Edie conference in the US
Pepolino Drew this picture
Petros collaborative modeling is one of the most important concepts of tdd
Pillows
But I felt it for some
Time that
Clematis modeling is
Important pillar of
DDD
I think that many people use it synonymously with a brainstorming everything's okay
So I use events coming to hear you see my colleagues
The big picture brainstorming session
How some of my colleagues
And I think of it as
I have a molding tool box
And Industry Pakistan several tools
Bike event storming and domain storytelling
And
I think that
Many projects you will have to use more than one modeling method
And you definitely have an advantage if disabled Tools in your toolbox and you know how to choose
Between those tools invented to switch to it will increase your chances of success
No thinking of it as a toolbox is
One way of seeing it
But I think Lotus modeling could also be described as a family of Networks
Different relationships between them
And
The more I became experience 50dd dimora looked at
A collaborative molding has his family
So in my mind
I would say that
I now see software development as a series of conversations
Edith by modeling
With different
Members of declarative modeling
Family
I'm the community behind those methods or tools they started to write a book
Call temperature Club
Correction tools book you can find it on ringtone
Download it come down
So this is a really thriving community
And it's great to see that
This family is ever expanding and to see new connections made between two stools
So this is definitely something that I'm has influenced me a lot
Notify no fault I want to share with you today is
One of the most important concepts of Thinkin DDD and get us to the language and models abound
Context
What is Australian iopener
I mean
What's
Can mean different things to different people right
So
Please make those people work in the same organization to might have different ideas
For example in a movie theater
What could stick at mean
So for one person it could be a syllable unit
Degenerates a prophet
And for the other person to come in a piece of paper that is Savella dated in order to Grant access to a movie theater
So if you look at the score screen to the main story from before again
Cassia might think of the ticket is something that they sell at this price and so on
Usher well they're not really interested in the price they're just checking if it's the right State and time let movie in Sindhi
Texas
So
The both
Say tickets bottom indifferent
Concepts Hindi mean ticket
Have this will often happen in
Call screens domain stories are also a collective modeling techniques that stakeholders
Used to sing transit mean exactly the same thing
This is not necessarily a problem
Especially in this course clean up
But
I want to show you an example where Julie was a problem for me
I'm too moderate the
The mother exception
Because it was immediate problem
Bed
Luckily I could resolve with the help of found a contacts
So this is yet another domain that tell me about
The time is
Pictures company called awesome browser games
A company that provides a platform for playing browser games
But it's based on a true story
So in the workshop in his Workshop pick a different people from different departments together
Terminix bug software Developers
And while we wanted to stop at for clothes screen to main story
That shows us an end-to-end process of first-time user science app
Place the first game gets billed for
So someone stopping and see while the first step is that the user opens an account with some browser games
And immediately someone said no
Does a note that count as much as great as much later I know that for a fact
But the first person replied no no no no no
You are welcome
This is the first step I know it I know that for a fact this is the first thing that we do they open the account
Well
The words of Martin Fowler
A single conceptual model is tricky piece to work with
Decals for trying to do a build a single conceptual model
Terms that cannot be reconciled
So bounded contexts due to the rescue what did we do to resolve the situation
Come forward
But I said okay let's assume for a moment that
The first person is right and that's the account is open in the first step and then be continued modeling
And eventually arrived at just stepped your distant far from the picture
But the second person thinks that the account is created
And we used to different items
To show that
Women different things are so different kinds of accounts possibly
And when we talked about it it became evident
Bad
One person
Thought about
The account in a context of user user registration
And the other person
I was thinking about accounts in a context of
Game management
So that actually two kinds of accounts here
Wounded
User display use a game so if you play different
Games with different accounts one feeds game
So luckily we had status
Concept of bounded contacts that help us to resolve this issue otherwise I don't think
They looked up with a peanut success but with this
Revelation 14
And actually you can use this kind of differences languages
To spot and find the identify bounded context so that's also way
How we used to maintain contacts
If you have to actually seeing another example already we used found context and Vivian mobile.
Send me the story of caustic
Cinema example
So then on the left in the crosswind story receive in the rectangles
I'm Different contacts
So if ticket sales next 1000
And the more detailed adamant story
That story place within one context within the ticket sales context and of course we want to make sure that would
In the ticket sales context
We have to say Madea
I'll start times today used there so
That we need all ubiquitous language
So these are the three things where I think DDS within influence domain storytelling
Influenced its development and also
My personal modeling practice
So we have to City of the mobile exploration whirlpool
Powerful metaphor
Neglected in the DD Community Saturday
And with this spectacle community of collaborative modeling
That is
But only within DDD but also extending to other communities like behavioral development for example
And we have to
Game-changing concept of
Found a context to the Adidas language remodels abounded by the contacts
Will you change my modeling practice
If you want to know more about stuman storytelling go check out to my store today.
Will find my stats on speaker.
And now I'm looking forward
Questions
Thank you
Okay thank you very much about touch-ups taken over story
Siderite
Okay can you see my screen
Okay the first question is
A song There Is No round trip between each component
Could you tell us what motivated you to do
Created created this one-way direction to his Crush
Message flow
I think this question refers to the
Examples of the case it's not sound correct
So
This is something that is typical of for software Developers
We often sing in this kind of request response
Tatem
Well you would like you you call the message and then you get a return with you
Do something like that
You can use the main storytelling in that way but I think it's the better
I did too
To use it to express an intention
Otherwise the picture becomes very messy with a lot of back and forth and back and forth and tickets
Without communicating without pushing the story forward
So that idea is that you express intention
And not necessarily things like
You know you ain't the something in the system in the Backpage to press the button and then the webpage randerson UHD
When you press the next button
Then it rained Us in uht milk a very boring that's not that's not a lot of
Information in its b b drives the conversation forward
So that's what I want to avoid and a focus more on
What is the intention of is that it's okay to have just one way information flow
Direction
Guardian
Okay thank you for your answer
Second question is
Have you ever met someone asking about the compression between domestic travel
Think about it
Question-and-answer solid the slides football pictures
I've been smoking Session India
Precipitated
Do you spoof
Plus many more
I would say for the last
The same amount like 50 50 something like that
That is an overlap there are situations where can you use one or the other and we'll still
Get a good result out of it
But they're also situations where I think one is better than the other and one of the
Indicators for me is what is this process about or what information
Are you looking to to learn but what I interested in
If it's about many people collaborating with each other so if you have a business process today rules
Many people on East medisoft assistants and information goes to one person to the next and back
And you're interested in the communication patterns and loading how people collaborate
Been a thing domain storytelling rooster better approach because it destroys Center.
People are going to extras
And you can we go see who is doing what
It's on the other hand if you're more interested in this time series like nothing in the rain storm timeline
From left to right
Status changes and just getting better and better and better
Event storming
But this is it
Are you are you supposed to use
Both
And you can also combine it
For example in in the perfect that I'm currently working on Vista
David wisdom in storytelling to figure out the process that this new software system should build
And then the development team decided they want to implement the software using event sourcing
So for Big Picture level with domain stories and 40 sign Rebel
For the system design we switched to events forming because it's much better to an event
Inconsistent
Their MO is to combine it's a Subaru for you to be booked for that
With a couple of examples
Okay is there is question is
Cantonment
Or a tool design in the examination of EDD technical design
I think there was a follow-up from
Gym in the in the chat so depends on different perspective and how much you're looking
Funtime serious consequences zodiac relationship status
Chicken sandwich
Fastest time
Yusuf
The funny thing about it is that the midst of it telling its predecessors are actually rather
So that the first
Ancestor the first Pig accessories from the 1990s
And it was heavily influenced by object-oriented modeling
So you can seal still see that influence and I think it is
Suitable
It's a tool for class modeling when you weren't an object oriented approach
And it also fits nicely into the digital thinking because you can look at the world
Objection Pilkey
This is going to be at an entity or at your gate or baby and very upset
Empty Aerosmith's depict activities
Well those are the
Behavior
So what's ample construction example we had
Permits and we had hearing and the hearing was started and statements
I'll consider it
And he's all just takes the bait that become entities than Aggregates hearing flip sample beat
The hearing is an aggregate
And and and stuff like that so that was what do you need for that you need to me
Make storytelling you need to make service that are out of fine-grained
But if you're not a very overview level this wouldn't work
But if you mostly try to find range
Then you have enough language and expressiveness in the model
If you can before tickling touch this time
Okay thank you very much
And the next question is
Mystery trolling employment in DVD
What do you think it is at advantage
And
Disadvantage
Most of the time Houston in storytelling as a communication tool
And the think that is
Apostle motortrust explained from there for the previous question with how you can use it to implemented
But mostly I think it's about bringing people people together
Having meaningful conversations about the domain and that is something that to domain storytelling
Really good at helping with this
So this would be the main advantage
And
Then you can drive the conversation two different directions for example you can use it to find
Obama contacts that would be a typical by fusing it to implement EDD
Or you can use it on a lower level
Design using energy saver Gibson's one
What about disadvantage ships well I'm a bit biased your clothes everyday
Ostomy storytelling so
It's a time to think about this advantages but
Box
Maybe just put it this week
It's not the right tool for everything
So that's why I always talked about his toolbox
End
I've had situations where
I thought you said this mother is a good idea and then we go into the workshop and it just doesn't work
For some reason for for whatever reason and then it's always good if your stool box of other modeling tools
Okay I'm sorry this conversation is not going forward but I have an idea let's use for example
Complimenting 222 figured it out oil let's use events for me and then you can switch
So I think this will be a disadvantage like tweeting it is a one-size-fits-all tools4ever
Situation that's not going to work
You evil
It's different stool to get to Bucks
Okay
DDD implementation
Such as in a banking
Aura financial industry
Cocoaplex domains
My colleagues and I have refused to stick meat and its predecessors for
Complex domains like healthcare banking insurance
Meditrim ports for sample stuff like
Disaster management disaster Disaster Response teams so
A whole lot of different domains Logistics of course
E-commerce
So it's not really
Bounce 21 domain 2344 pretty much every domain
So I guess nothing counted adomania twice LP dispersant picture
So I would stay true to say this is musically complex to me
Okay thank you
Orientation
How do you run into a football player one object can either be a working object
Oregon indifference sequence of 1pst image
How do we deal with it
Advanced
So
Weather
What day does the name of course it can happen that
In Wonderland story something is an external in wonderment service something is the workup check
Similarly two-in-one Bobbitt contact you can model something is an entity
And in the next round of context it's a video check because he doesn't change
So if it's possible but this question is about in the same picture in the same room easily
Again
For example if we think about something like
Use a management user registration you sign up for something you other user your than actor them
And you open your account
And then the system creates a user as a representation of the
Human being
Then we have
User as an extra antenna web user is a work of check to the same picture
Another problem at all to use a different I can
To hit the sense that
So I would use this to stick figure for the for the extra for the person
And f*** somebody I can set that I use it's the Google material I can set
They have another smaller picture of a diffuser before the check mark
And it's the one that I typically use for stuff like user account
Batman
So that's that's the way how I deal with it so you stiffen icons to represent those two
Different concepts
Infinity Wars
Okay
Oster realization of protaras or service
Astrology or 20 that's domain storytelling usually it's just great
Crystal form or complete angel
Evo payments process
Requirements to system development
So
One of the
Tools of the methods that are used a lot in combination with
Domain storytelling
Is user story mapping
Why
Because of two reasons so
Always about
Cenarios do about typical
